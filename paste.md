In JavaScript, you can obtain the current timestamp using the `Date` object and its methods. Below are some common approaches:

### 1. Using `Date.now()`
This method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 (Unix Epoch).
```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now();
console.log(timestamp); // Example output: 1716440943000
```
This is the most efficient way to get a timestamp in milliseconds.

### 2. Using the `Date` Object
You can also use the `new Date()` constructor and convert it to a timestamp.
```javascript
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
console.log(timestamp); // Example output: 1716440943000
```
Alternatively, you can use `.valueOf()`:
```javascript
const timestamp = new Date().valueOf();
console.log(timestamp); // Example output: 1716440943000
```
Both `.getTime()` and `.valueOf()` return the timestamp in milliseconds.

### 3. Using `Math.floor()` for Seconds
If you need the timestamp in seconds, divide by 1000 and use `Math.floor()` to round down:
```javascript
const timestampInSeconds = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
console.log(timestampInSeconds); // Example output: 1716440943
```

### Best Practices
- Use `Date.now()` when you need a quick, lightweight timestamp without creating a `Date` object.
- Use `new Date().getTime()` when working with an actual date instance.
- Convert to seconds when working with APIs or databases that expect Unix timestamps in seconds.
