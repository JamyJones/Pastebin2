## JSON Web Token (JWT) and Supabase Authentication Policy Modification

---

### Explanation

#### 1. What is JWT?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. Supabase uses JWT to authenticate users and manage access control.

#### 2. Modifying Supabase Policy to Use `user_id`
Instead of checking authentication via email, you can modify the policy to verify users based on their `user_id`, which is the primary key in your database.

Hereâ€™s the modified policy:

```sql
create policy "Enable update for users based on user_id"
on "public"."User Profiles"
for update using (
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id
) with check (
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id
);
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- `auth.uid()` returns the authenticated user's unique identifier (`user_id`).
- The policy ensures that only the authenticated user can update their own profile.

---

#### 3. Authenticating Without JWT
Supabase primarily relies on JWT for authentication. However, if you want to authenticate users without JWT, you may need to:
- Use **Row Level Security (RLS)** with `auth.uid()` for direct user verification.
- Implement **third-party authentication providers** (OAuth, Magic Links, etc.).
- Use **database triggers** to manage user access without relying on JWT.

---

### Example
If a user with `user_id = '1234-5678'` is authenticated, the policy ensures that only this user can update their profile.
