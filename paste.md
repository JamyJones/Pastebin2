### **Explanation**<br>

#### **1. Importance of Clarity in Confirmation Emails**<br>
Ensuring clarity in your email is crucial as users need straightforward instructions to complete the authentication process. A well-structured message reduces confusion and improves user engagement.<br>

#### **2. Essential Components of Your Message**<br>
Your confirmation email should include:
- **Subject Line**: Clear and relevant, indicating authentication confirmation.
- **Header**: Reinforces the purpose of the email.
- **Body Content**: Explains why the email was sent and what action the user needs to take.
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: A visible button or link guiding the user to complete authentication.
- **Footer**: Includes contact details for support and legal disclaimers.<br>

#### **3. Using Bootstrap 5 for Email Styling**<br>
