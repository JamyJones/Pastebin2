Your SQL policy syntax appears close to the style used in PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies, but there are some issues to address:

1. **Policy Context:**  
   - The syntax for creating a policy in PostgreSQL RLS requires `CREATE POLICY` with a specific classification of `FOR` (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `USING/WITH CHECK` expressions).  
   - For UPSERT (i.e., insert or update), you generally need to create policies for both `UPDATE` and `INSERT`. PostgreSQL does not have an explicit `UPSERT` policy, but it allows defining policies that govern both operations.

2. **Placement of `USING` and `WITH CHECK`:**  
   - In PostgreSQL, each policy can specify both `USING` (which filters rows for update/delete/select) and `WITH CHECK` (which verifies data validity during insert/update).  
   - When creating a policy that governs `INSERT` and `UPDATE`, you set criteria appropriate for both.

3. **Current syntax issues:**  
   - `CREATE POLICY` statement requires specifying the targeted table/view.  
   - The clause `FOR UPSERT` is invalid; instead, you should create separate policies for `INSERT` and `UPDATE`, or create one with `FOR ALL` and specify rules accordingly.  
   - The code snippet provided is a bit ambiguous in how it applies to UPSERT.

### Corrected Example for PostgreSQL RLS Policies

Assuming you want to allow authenticated users to only insert or update their own profile picture in `storage.objects`, the policy might look like this:

```sql
-- Enable row-level security on the table if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for INSERT operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for profile pictures"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
WHEN (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures'
    AND name = auth.uid()::text || '/profile.jpg'
    AND auth.uid()::text = auth.user.id
)
TO authenticated_users;

-- Policy for UPDATE operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow update for profile pictures"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
USING (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures'
    AND name = auth.uid()::text || '/profile.jpg'
    AND auth.uid()::text = auth.user.id
)
TO authenticated_users;
```

### Notes:
- Replace `auth.uid()` and `auth.user.id` with your actual authentication context.
- Joining multiple policies allows precise control: one for `INSERT` and another for `UPDATE`.
- Use `USING` for controlling read/deletion permissions; use `WITH CHECK` for insert/update validation. If needed, include `WITH CHECK` as well.

---

### Summary:
- PostgreSQL policies are associated with tables or views.
- Policies specify `FOR INSERT`, `FOR UPDATE`, etc.
- Use `USING` for row filtering (read, delete, update), and `WITH CHECK` for validation during insert/update.
- `UPSERT` is handled via separate policies for `INSERT` and `UPDATE`.

Let me know if you want the full combined policy or if youâ€™re using a specific SQL dialect or extension (e.g., Supabase policies).
