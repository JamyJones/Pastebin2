To create a separate bundle for React libraries (`react` and `react-dom`) and include it in your project, follow these steps:

### 1. Setup Entry Point for React Libraries
Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js`, where you will import React and ReactDOM:

```js
// my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

window.React = React;
window.ReactDOM = ReactDOM;
```

This way, React and ReactDOM are globally available as `window.React` and `window.ReactDOM`, which makes it easier to load separately.

### 2. Create a Bundling Script for React Libraries
Update your `package.json` scripts to generate the React bundle:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "babel my_app/static/js/index.js --out-file dist/index.min.js",
  "build-react": "webpack --entry ./my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js --output-path ./dist --output-filename all_react.js"
}
```

**Note:** Since you're already using Babel for transpiling, for bundling external libraries, it's more straightforward to use **Webpack**.

### 3. Set Up Webpack for React Bundling
Create a simple `webpack.config.js` in your project root (or wherever appropriate):

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'all_react.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  mode: 'production', // Minifies output
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

This configuration tells Webpack to bundle `react` and `react-dom` into a single file `dist/all_react.js`.

### 4. Install Webpack Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli babel-loader
```

### 5. Build the React Bundle
Run the command:

```bash
npm run build-react
```

This will generate `dist/all_react.js` containing React and ReactDOM.

---

### 6. Include React Bundle and Your App in HTML
In your HTML, add:

```html
<!-- Load React libraries first -->
<script src="/static/dist/all_react.js"></script>

<!-- Your app's bundle (processed with Babel) -->
<script src="/static/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

Ensure the order is correct: **React libraries first**, then your transpiled code.

---

### 7. Update Babel Build Script as Needed
Your existing Babel script remains unchanged, just build your app code separately:

```json
"build": "babel my_app/static/js/index.js --out-file dist/index.min.js"
```

### **Summary**
- Use Webpack to bundle React and ReactDOM separately into `all_react.js`.
- Load this bundle before your application code in HTML.
- Use Babel to transpile your app JS code separately.

---

### **Optional: Using Module System Instead of Globals**
Alternatively, if you prefer to use ES Modules and a build system that supports modules, you can bundle React into your main bundle using Webpack and import React where needed, avoiding global variablesâ€”but the above method is simpler for traditional script inclusion.
