You asked about the numeric type in PostgreSQL and how it differs from int2, int4, and int8.

**numeric** is a variable-precision, exact numeric data type. It can store numbers with a large number of digits both before and after the decimal point, making it suitable for financial calculations or cases where precision is critical.

**int2**, **int4**, and **int8** are fixed-size integer types:
- **int2**: 2-byte signed integer (range: -32,768 to 32,767)
- **int4**: 4-byte signed integer (range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- **int8**: 8-byte signed integer (range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)

**Key Differences:**
- **Precision:** numeric supports arbitrary precision; int2/int4/int8 have fixed precision.
- **Storage:** numeric uses variable storage depending on the number size; int2/int4/int8 use fixed storage.
- **Use Case:** Use numeric for exact values (e.g., money), and int types for whole numbers within their respective ranges.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (
    amount numeric(10,2), -- up to 10 digits, 2 after decimal
    small_count int2,
    regular_count int4,
    large_count int8
);
```
