To create a truly **independent** (standalone) bundle that doesn't depend on React or ReactDOM at runtime, you need to **bundle all dependencies into a single file**. Essentially, you want to produce a UMD or IIFE bundle that includes React and ReactDOM so that the output file does not require these libraries to be loaded separately via script tags.

The main steps are:

1. Use a bundler like **Webpack**, **Rollup**, or **Parcel** rather than just Babel (which only transpiles).
2. Bundle React and ReactDOM into your output.
3. Configure the bundler to generate a self-contained file.

### Example using **Rollup**

Rollup is a popular choice for bundling libraries or app code into a standalone bundle.

#### 1. Install Rollup and plugins

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs
```

#### 2. Create a `rollup.config.js`

```js
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';

export default {
  input: 'my_app/static/js/index.js', // Your entry point
  output: {
    file: 'dist/bundle.js',
    format: 'iife', // For browser usage; or 'umd' as needed
    name: 'MyApp', // global variable name if using IIFE/UMD
    globals: {
      react: 'React',
      'react-dom': 'ReactDOM'
    }
  },
  external: [], // No external dependencies; bundle everything
  plugins: [
    resolve(),
    commonjs()
  ]
};
```

Make sure your `index.js` imports React and ReactDOM normally, like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => <div>Hello World</div>;

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

#### 3. Run Rollup

```bash
npx rollup -c
```

This generates a `dist/bundle.js` file containing your code **and** React/ReactDOM.

### Additional: Avoid External Dependencies

In the config above, **do not mark React and ReactDOM as external**, so Rollup includes them in the bundle.

---

### Summary

- Babel alone cannot bundle dependencies; it only transpiles.
- Use a bundler like **Rollup** or **Webpack** for creating a standalone bundle.
- Ensure React and ReactDOM are not marked as external, so they are bundled in.
- Choose output formats (`iife`/`umd`) suitable for browser usage.

---

### Optional: Use Webpack

If you want Webpack, the setup involves:

- Setting `externals: []` (or not setting externals)
- Configuring the output as a single bundle
- Including React and ReactDOM in the bundle

---

### Conclusion

To make your React bundle independent and not require external React dependencies at runtime, **bundle React and ReactDOM into your output file using a bundler like Rollup or Webpack**, configured to generate a self-contained script.
