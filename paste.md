People can make money with software in various ways, and the case of Facebook (now Meta Platforms, Inc.) is a prime example. Here are some common methods through which software companies, including Facebook, generate revenue:

1. **Advertising Revenue**: 
   - Facebook primarily makes money through advertising. Businesses pay to display ads to Facebook's vast user base. The platform uses sophisticated algorithms to target ads based on user data, interests, and behaviors, making them more effective.

2. **Subscription Models**: 
   - Some software companies offer premium features or services through subscription models. Users pay a recurring fee for access to additional functionalities or an ad-free experience.

3. **In-App Purchases**: 
   - Many software applications, especially mobile apps and games, offer in-app purchases. Users can buy virtual goods, additional features, or content within the app.

4. **Data Monetization**: 
   - Companies can analyze user data to gain insights and sell aggregated data to third parties, although this raises privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny.

5. **Licensing and Partnerships**: 
   - Software companies can license their technology to other businesses or form partnerships to integrate their services, generating revenue through fees or profit-sharing agreements.

6. **E-commerce and Marketplace**: 
   - Platforms like Facebook have integrated e-commerce features, allowing businesses to sell products directly through the platform, earning a commission on sales.

7. **Affiliate Marketing**: 
   - Some software platforms earn money by promoting third-party products and earning a commission for each sale made through their referral links.

8. **Freemium Model**: 
   - Offering a basic version of the software for free while charging for advanced features or services can attract a large user base, some of whom may convert to paying customers.

9. **Crowdfunding and Investments**: 
   - Startups often raise money through crowdfunding or venture capital investments, which can provide the necessary funds to develop and scale their software.

In the case of Facebook, the combination of advertising revenue, user engagement, and data analytics has allowed it to become one of the most profitable software companies in the world.
