To position a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window in a web browser, you generally have limited direct control over its position because the PiP window is managed by the browser independently from your webpage for security and user experience reasons. However, there are some strategies and best practices you can consider:

---

### 1. **Triggering Picture-in-Picture Mode**

First, ensure you have the logic to initiate PiP mode correctly using the `requestPictureInPicture()` API:

```javascript
const video = document.querySelector('video');

async function enterPiP() {
  if (document.pictureInPictureElement) {
    await document.exitPictureInPicture();
  }
  await video.requestPictureInPicture();
}
```

---

### 2. **Positioning the PiP Window**

**Important:** There is no API to directly set the position of the PiP window via JavaScript or CSS because the PiP window is controlled by the browser. Its position can be changed manually by the user by dragging the window.

---

### 3. **Guidelines and Best Practices**

- **User Experience (UX):**  
  Guide users on how to position the PiP window through UI hints or instructions. 

- **Designing for PiP:**  
  Ensure your video content is centered and visually clear for when the user moves the window manually.

- **Multiple PiP Windows:**  
  Managing multiple videos or controlling a PiP session programmatically isn't standardized across browsers.

---

### 4. **Alternative Approaches**

While you cannot programmatically set the position, **you can influence your own UI layout**:
- Create a "simulated" floating video using a `<div>` styled with `position: fixed;` for static or draggable UI elements.  
- For true PiP, the user has control.

---

### 5. **Example: Implementing a Draggable Video as an Alternative**

```html
<style>
  #floatVideo {
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    right: 20px;
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    background: black;
    cursor: move;
    z-index: 1000;
  }
</style>

<video id="floatVideo" src="video.mp4" controls></video>

<script>
  const video = document.getElementById('floatVideo');

  let isDragging = false;
  let offsetX, offsetY;

  video.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    isDragging = true;
    offsetX = e.clientX - video.offsetLeft;
    offsetY = e.clientY - video.offsetTop;
  });

  document.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    isDragging = false;
  });

  document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    if (isDragging) {
      video.style.left = e.clientX - offsetX + 'px';
      video.style.top = e.clientY - offsetY + 'px';
      video.style.position = 'fixed';
    }
  });
</script>
```

This approach mimics a floating window that you control programmatically, giving similar flexibility to position where the user prefers, but **this is not true PiP**.

---

### **Summary**

- **In Standard Web APIs:**
  - You **cannot set** the position of the browser's PiP window programmatically.
  - Users control the position manually.

- **Workaround:**
  - Use a floating `<div>` with `position: fixed` and draggable behavior to simulate a PiP-like window that allows full positional control.

If your goal is strictly to programmatically influence PiP position, unfortunately, **this isn't possible with current Web APIs**; browser security and UX guidelines prevent this to protect user autonomy.
