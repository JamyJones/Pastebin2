To fix an element at the top within its parent `div` bounds in CSS, you can use `position: absolute;` while ensuring the parent `div` has `position: relative;`. Here's how:

```css
.parent {
    position: relative; /* Ensures the child is positioned relative to this container */
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 1px solid #000;
}

.fixed-element {
    position: absolute; /* Positions relative to the parent */
    top: 0; /* Fixes it at the top */
    left: 0;
    width: 100%; /* Adjust as needed */
    background-color: lightblue;
}
```

And the HTML:

```html
<div class="parent">
    <div class="fixed-element">Fixed at top within parent</div>
    <p>Other content inside the parent div</p>
</div>
```

### Explanation:
- The `.parent` element has `position: relative;`, ensuring the child `.fixed-element` is positioned within it rather than the entire viewport.
- The `.fixed-element` has `position: absolute;`, which allows it to stay fixed at the top (`top: 0;`) within the parent container.
- Additional styling ensures it spans the full width of the parent.

This approach maintains the element's fixed position inside its parent's boundaries, preventing it from escaping outside the container. Let me know if you need adjustments for responsiveness or additional styling!
