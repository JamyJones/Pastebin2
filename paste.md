Great question! Choosing between plain JavaScript (vanilla JS) and React for building a social media application depends on several factors, including project complexity, your development goals, and your current skillset.

### When to Use Plain JavaScript
- **Simple applications**: If the project is straightforward with minimal interactivity.
- **Learning and understanding fundamentals**: To grasp DOM manipulation, event handling, and core web concepts.
- **Limited dependencies**: If you want an ultra-lightweight application without the need for a build step or additional libraries.

### When to Use React
- **Complex UI & State Management**: React excels at managing complex, interactive UIs with ease.
- **Component Reusability**: Building reusable components is straightforward.
- **Scalability and Maintenance**: React’s architecture helps organize larger projects more sustainably.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to libraries like Redux, React Router, and Material UI for faster development.

### Recommended Approach for Your Social Media App
Given a social media application involves:
- Multiple pages or views (feed, profile, messaging)
- Dynamic UI updates
- Handling user interactions
- Managing state (like feeds, notifications, user data)

React offers significant productivity advantages and will likely make your development process smoother, especially as the app grows.

### Your Current Skill Level
Since you're confident in JavaScript but only intermediate in React:
- **Start with React**: It builds on your JS knowledge. You can leverage your JS skills to understand React concepts.
- **Incremental learning**: Focus on mastering React hooks, state management, and routing gradually.
- **Optimal use of vanilla JS**: For small, isolated features, vanilla JavaScript can still be effective within a React app, especially with direct DOM manipulations or utility functions.

### Example: Basic React Structure for a Social Media Feed
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Feed() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch posts from your backend API
    fetch('/api/posts')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setPosts(data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching posts:', error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>News Feed</h2>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <div key={post.id} className="post">
          <h3>{post.author}</h3>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Feed;
```

### Best Practices
- Use React functional components with hooks.
- Leverage React Router for navigation.
- Manage global state with Context API or libraries like Redux if needed.
- Structure your project modularly — separate components, hooks, services.

### Final Advice
- **Build a prototype in React**: Use your intermediate skills to get comfortable with the framework.
- **Deepen your React knowledge** over time.
- **Combine** your JavaScript expertise with React to write maintainable, scalable code.
