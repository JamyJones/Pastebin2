You asked how to get the current timestamp in JavaScript.  
The most common and professional way is to use Date.now(), which returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch):

```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now();
console.log(timestamp); // Example output: 1719936000000
```

Alternatively, you can use the getTime() method on a Date object:

```javascript
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
console.log(timestamp);
```

Both approaches are widely used and considered best practice for obtaining the current timestamp in JavaScript.  
Is there anything else youâ€™d like to know about JavaScript or web development?
