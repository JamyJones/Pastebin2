The error message indicates that the entry point for your Webpack configuration is being defined multiple times, which is not allowed. In your case, it seems that the entry point `./my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js` is being included more than once.

To resolve this issue, you should check if there are any other configurations or files that might be including the same entry point. However, if you are certain that your `webpack.config.js` is the only configuration file, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check for Duplicate Entries**: Ensure that you are not accidentally including the same entry file in another part of your Webpack configuration or in any other configuration files that might be merged with this one.

2. **Use an Array for Multiple Entries**: If you intend to have multiple entry points, you can define them as an array. For example:

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {
     entry: ['./my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js'], // Use an array if you have multiple entries
     output: {
       filename: 'all_react.js',
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
     },
     mode: 'production', // Minifies output
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.js$/,
           exclude: /node_modules/,
           use: {
             loader: 'babel-loader',
           },
         },
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Check for Other Configurations**: If you are using a tool that merges Webpack configurations (like `webpack-merge`), ensure that the entry point is not being defined in multiple places.

4. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, Webpack might cache configurations. Try clearing the cache or running Webpack with the `--no-cache` option.

After making these changes, try running your Webpack build again. If the issue persists, double-check your project structure and any other Webpack-related files that might be affecting the configuration.
