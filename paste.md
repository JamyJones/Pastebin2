The time it takes to learn React depends on several factors, including your prior experience with JavaScript and web development. Here's a general breakdown:

1. **Beginner (2–4 weeks)** – If you're new to JavaScript, spend time mastering ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and promises. Once comfortable, start learning React fundamentals: components, props, state, and JSX.

2. **Intermediate (1–3 months)** – Learn key concepts like hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), context API for state management, and React Router for navigation. Work on small projects to strengthen your understanding.

3. **Advanced (3+ months)** – Dive into performance optimization, React Query, Redux for state management, and component design patterns. Building complex applications will improve your proficiency.

### Best Practices for Learning React:
- **Follow Official Documentation** – React's documentation is well-structured and regularly updated.
- **Build Projects** – Hands-on experience speeds up learning.
- **Understand Component Architecture** – Master reusable components for better scalability.
- **Explore Modern Tools** – Learn Vite, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to enhance development workflows.
