To get the current timestamp in JavaScript, you typically use the `Date` object along with its methods to retrieve the timestamp.

### Using `Date.now()`
This method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 (UTC).
```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now();
console.log(timestamp); // Example output: 1716348543000
```
**Best Practice**: `Date.now()` is the most efficient way to get a timestamp since it avoids creating a new `Date` instance.

### Using `new Date().getTime()`
This is another common approach:
```javascript
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
console.log(timestamp);
```
This method creates a new `Date` object and then retrieves the timestamp.

### Using `new Date().toISOString()` for a Readable Format
If you need a human-readable timestamp, use:
```javascript
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
console.log(timestamp); // Example output: "2025-05-23T07:49:03.000Z"
```
This provides the timestamp in ISO 8601 format.

### Summary
- **Use `Date.now()`** for performance efficiency.
- **Use `new Date().getTime()`** if you already need a `Date` object for other operations.
- **Use `new Date().toISOString()`** for a human-readable timestamp.
