There are several JavaScript libraries that can help you build a leaderboard efficiently. Here are a few options:

1. **LiveLike Leaderboards** – This library provides API-based leaderboard management, allowing you to retrieve leaderboard entries, rankings, and associated details dynamically [[0]](https://docs.livelike.com/docs/javascript-leaderboards).
2. **Custom HTML/JavaScript Leaderboard** – If you prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create a leaderboard using vanilla JavaScript and HTML, sorting and styling entries dynamically [[1]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47918195/creating-a-basic-html-javascript-leaderboard).
3. **Leaderboard Project on GitHub** – This open-source project demonstrates how to build a leaderboard using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs, making it a great reference for implementation [[2]](https://github.com/techmoves/Leaderboard).
