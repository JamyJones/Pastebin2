In JavaScript, a `switch` statement is used to evaluate an expression against multiple possible values, executing the corresponding code block of the first matching case. If no case matches, an optional `default` block is executed.

### Structure & Flow:
1. The `switch` expression is evaluated once.
2. The `case` clauses are checked sequentially.
3. If a match is found, the code inside the `case` block executes.
4. Without a `break` statement, execution continues through subsequent cases.
5. If no matching case is found, the `default` block (if present) executes.

### Example:
```javascript
let day = "Tuesday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the workweek.");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("Second day of the workweek.");
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
    case "Thursday":
        console.log("Midweek days.");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("End of the workweek!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("It's the weekend!");
}
```

### Best Practices:
- Always use `break` to prevent fall-through, unless intentional.
- Use `default` for unmatched cases.
- Avoid complex expressions; `switch` works best with direct value comparisons.
- Consider `if-else` when dealing with ranges or boolean conditions.
