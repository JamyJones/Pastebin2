## Summary 
**Understanding JWT and Modifying Database Policies in Supabase**

---

**Explanation:** 

**What is JWT**
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- It is **commonly used** for **authentication and authorization** in web applications.
- A JWT consists of **three parts**: header, payload, and signature. The payload contains **claims**, which are statements about an entity (usually the user) and additional data.
- In the context of Supabase, **JWTs** are used to authenticate users and include claims like **user ID**, **email**, etc.
- Example: A JWT can be decoded to reveal the **user's email** and **user ID**, which are then used in security policies.

---

**Supabase Policy Modification**
- Your current policy **uses** `auth.jwt()` to access the email claim and compare it against the email column.
- The goal is to **modify** the policy to use `user_id`, which **matches the userâ€™s primary key**.
- Also, you requested to **authenticate without JWT**, but in Supabase, JWTs are the standard method for assigning user identities.
- **Note:** Without JWT, **Supabase won't automatically recognize** the authenticated user unless you use other mechanisms like **PostgreSQL roles or session variables**.

---

**Modified Policy Using user_id (Preferred Method in Supabase)**
```sql
create policy "Enable update for users based on user_id"
on "public"."User Profiles"
for update using (
  auth.uid() = user_id
) with check (
  auth.uid() = user_id
);
```

- **Explanation of the changes:**
  - `auth.uid()`: Function provided by Supabase that **returns the authenticated user's ID**.
  - This policy **ensures** only the user with matching **user_id** can update their profile.

---

**Note on Authentication Without JWT**
- Supabase **relies on JWTs** for user auth.
- To **authenticate without JWT**, you would need to set **PostgreSQL session variables** or **manage authentication manually**, which **is not typical**.
- **Example** (not recommended for production): You might set a session variable with `set_config()` and refer to it, but **this is not secure**.

---

**Practical Usage:**
- When a user logs in, Supabase assigns their **`auth.uid()`**.
- Your policies should then use `auth.uid()` to check permissions based on user ID, **not email**.
- Ensuring **correct security policies** helps prevent unauthorized access.
