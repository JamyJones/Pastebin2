The error you're encountering is a **foreign key constraint violation** in your database. Specifically, it indicates that you're attempting to update or delete a row in the `"User Profiles"` table, but this row is still referenced by the `"leaderboard"` table via a foreign key constraint `"fk_username"`.

### Explanation
- **Error Code `23503`**: PostgreSQL's foreign key violation error.
- **Cause**: You're trying to delete or update a user profile that is still being referenced in the `"leaderboard"` table.
- **Foreign Key Constraint**: Ensures referential integrity, preventing orphaned references.

### How to resolve this?

#### 1. **Identify the references**
Check which records in `"leaderboard"` depend on the user profile you're trying to modify or delete:

```sql
SELECT * FROM leaderboard WHERE username = 'target_username';
```

#### 2. **Decide on the desired action**

- If you want to **delete** the user profile:
  - You must **first delete** or **update** related rows in `"leaderboard"`.
  - Or, set the foreign key to **cascade delete** (recommended if suitable).

- If you want to **update** the user profile's `username`:
  - Ensure no references are broken or update all dependent rows accordingly.

### Best Practice Approaches

#### **A. Use ON DELETE CASCADE / ON UPDATE CASCADE**

Modify the foreign key constraint to automatically handle deletions or updates:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
DROP CONSTRAINT fk_username;

ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_username
FOREIGN KEY (username)
REFERENCES "User Profiles"(username)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

This way:
- When a user profile is deleted, all related leaderboard entries are automatically removed.
- When a username is updated, related entries are updated accordingly.

**Note:** Be cautious using cascading deletes/updates, as they can lead to unintentional data loss.

#### **B. Manual Handling (Application-level logic)**

Before deleting a user profile, delete related leaderboard entries:

```js
// Example using Supabase client
const username = 'target_username';

// Delete related leaderboard entries first
await supabase
  .from('leaderboard')
  .delete()
  .eq('username', username);

// Then delete user profile
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('User Profiles')
  .delete()
  .eq('username', username);

if (error) {
  console.error(error);
} else {
  console.log('User profile and related leaderboard entries deleted successfully.');
}
```

### Summary
- **Foreign key constraint violations** occur when deleting or updating parent records that are referenced by child tables.
- Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON UPDATE CASCADE` if automatic behavior fits your data integrity strategy.
- Or, **manually handle dependent records** in the application logic before deleting or updating parent records.

### Additional tip:
Always **backup your data** before altering constraints or performing mass delete/update operations in production environments.
