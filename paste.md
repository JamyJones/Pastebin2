## PostgreSQL Error 42601: WITH CHECK Cannot Be Applied to SELECT or DELETE

---

### Explanation:

#### **1. Understanding Error 42601**
PostgreSQL error **42601** is a **syntax error** that occurs when an SQL statement is incorrectly structured. In this case, the error message states that `WITH CHECK` cannot be applied to `SELECT` or `DELETE` operations.

#### **2. Why Does This Error Occur?**
- The `WITH CHECK` clause is used in **row-level security policies** to enforce conditions on **INSERT** and **UPDATE** operations.
- However, `WITH CHECK` **does not apply** to `SELECT` or `DELETE` operations because these operations do not modify data in a way that requires validation.
- When defining a policy for `DELETE`, PostgreSQL expects a `USING` clause instead of `WITH CHECK`.

#### **3. Correcting the Policy Definition**
To fix this error, replace `WITH CHECK` with `USING`, which is the correct clause for `DELETE` operations:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete their profile"
ON "public"."User Profiles"
FOR DELETE
USING ("User Id" = auth.uid());
```

#### **4. Explanation of the Fix**
- `USING ("User Id" = auth.uid());` ensures that only the authenticated user can delete their own profile.
- The `USING` clause is evaluated **before** the deletion occurs, ensuring that only rows meeting the condition are deleted.

### Example:

If you wanted to create a policy for **INSERT** or **UPDATE**, you would use `WITH CHECK`:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update their profile"
ON "public"."User Profiles"
FOR UPDATE
WITH CHECK ("User Id" = auth.uid());
```

This ensures that only authenticated users can update their own profile.
