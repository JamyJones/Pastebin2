To modify your Supabase storage policy to allow only read access to JPEG files (`.jpg`) uploaded by other users, you should consider the following:

- You want to **allow read** operations (`select`) only.
- The policy should restrict access to objects with `.jpg` extension.
- The policy should ensure that users can only read files **not** their own or perhaps only those uploaded by others, depending on your use case.

Assuming your goal is:

- **Allow any authenticated or anonymous user to read JPEG files uploaded by any other user**.
- **Prevent users from reading their own files (or, if not necessary, allow all except the upload user)**.

Below is an example of a policy that allows **read-only (`select`)** for **all users** on `.jpg` files, regardless of ownership:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Read JPEGs for all users"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Restrict to JPEG files
  storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'
)
WITH CHECK (
  -- No restriction on uploads, so this policy is for read access only
);
```

**If** you want to restrict access to only **reading JPEG files uploaded by other users** (e.g., deny access to the user's own files), you'll need a way to identify the owner of the file versus the current user.

Suppose your objects table has a `owner_id` column that links the object to the user who uploaded it, and `auth.uid()` gives the current user ID. The policy could be:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow read-only access to JPEGs uploaded by others"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Only JPEG files
  storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'
  -- And the uploader is not the current user
  AND owner_id != auth.uid()
);
```

**Important notes:**

- The `storage."extension"` function is used to filter by file extension.
- The `owner_id` field should be present in your storage objects table and should store the user ID of the uploader.
- If such an `owner_id` does not exist, you can add it upon upload or manage ownership differently.

### Summary:

- For **read-only access to all JPEGs**, regardless of ownership:
  
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Read JPEGs for all users"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'
);
```

- For **read-only access to JPEGs uploaded by others**:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow read-only access to JPEGs uploaded by others"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'
  AND owner_id != auth.uid()
);
```

Replace or adapt according to your schema.
