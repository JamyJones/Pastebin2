## Summary
Creating a Supabase database table for user profiles with specific columns and access policies.

### Explanation

#### 1. **Creating the `profile` table**
To store user details such as name, streak, and last seen, we need to define a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement with appropriate columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.profile (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    streak INT,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP
);
```

- **`user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY`**: Defines a unique identifier for each user as the primary key. UUID is preferred for unique IDs, especially in distributed systems.
- **`name TEXT`**: Holds user's name.
- **`streak INT`**: Stores the number of hours spent or other streak metrics as an integer.
- **`last_seen TIMESTAMP`**: Records the last time the user was active.

#### 2. **Inserting Data into the Profile Table**
You can insert a user profile like so:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.profile (user_id, name, streak, last_seen)
VALUES ('your-uuid-here', 'John Doe', 5, NOW());
```

- Use `NOW()` to automatically insert the current timestamp for `last_seen`.

#### 3. **Setting up Access Policies**
Your current policy grants **read access** (select) to **all users**:

```sql
create policy "Enable read access for all users"
on "public"."User Profiles"
for select using (true);
```

- To apply this policy to your new `profile` table, modify it for the correct table name, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON public.profile
FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```

- Additionally, since you're managing user-specific data, you may want to add **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** policies based on the user's `user_id`. For example:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow user to manage their profile" ON public.profile
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

*(Note: `auth.uid()` gets the current userâ€™s ID in Supabase auth.)*

### Practical Example:
Suppose you want to create a profile for a user with UUID `'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'`:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.profile (user_id, name, streak, last_seen)
VALUES ('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'Alice', 10, NOW());
```
