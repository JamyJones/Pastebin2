When deciding whether to use an array or an object to pass data in JavaScript (especially for destructuring), consider the following factors:

### 1. **Semantic Meaning and Clarity**
- **Use an object if:**
  - The data has named attributes, meaning each piece of data can be identified by a descriptive key.
  - You want the code to be more readable and self-explanatory.
- **Use an array if:**
  - The data is ordered and its position is meaningful.
  - You’re working with a list of similar items rather than distinct named attributes.

### 2. **Destructuring Syntax and Readability**
- **Object destructuring:**
  ```javascript
  const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
  const { name, age } = user;
  ```
  - Clarifies which data is being extracted — very useful when destructuring multiple variables.
  
- **Array destructuring:**
  ```javascript
  const coordinates = [10, 20];
  const [x, y] = coordinates;
  ```
  - Suitable when position matters, especially with tuples or ordered data.

### 3. **Default Values and Renaming**
- **Objects**:
  ```javascript
  const { name: username = 'Guest' } = user;
  ```
- **Arrays**:
  ```javascript
  const [first = 0, second = 0] = coords;
  ```

### 4. **Use Cases Summary**
| Use Arrays | Use Objects |
|--------------|--------------|
| Ordered data | Named data |
| Simple lists or tuples | Complex data with multiple attributes |
| When order is guaranteed | When clarity or explicit naming is preferred |

### **Best Practice Recommendations:**
- For configuration options, options objects are preferred for clarity.
- For returning multiple values from a function, arrays are common when the position is meaningful.
- When passing data with multiple named fields, **use objects**.

### **Example: Passing Data for a Function**

**Using an object (preferred for clarity):**
```javascript
function createUser({ name, age, email }) {
  // Use variables directly
  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}, Email: ${email}`);
}

createUser({ name: 'Alice', age: 30, email: 'alice@example.com' });
```

**Using an array (less clear, position-dependent):**
```javascript
function createUser([name, age, email]) {
  // Must remember the order
  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}, Email: ${email}`);
}

createUser(['Alice', 30, 'alice@example.com']);
```

### **Conclusion:**
- **Prefer objects** when passing data with named attributes for clarity and maintainability.
- Use **arrays** for ordered, positional data where the position has intrinsic meaning.
