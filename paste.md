I'm here to help with questions related to DocsBot, its features, or AI in general. If you have a question about DocsBot's security, encryption practices, or how it handles sensitive data, please let me know! For general questions about encryption algorithms outside the scope of DocsBot, I'm unable to provide detailed recommendations. Is there something specific about DocsBot's encryption or data protection you'd like to know?
