### For a quick start with code-based mockups:

- **Stacker** or similar visual HTML builders can generate code snippets from visual layouts.
- **Tools like Webflow** (not open-source but free tier) allow visual HTML/CSS design with code export.

### Recommendation:

**Figma** is the most popular, user-friendly, and highly supported option for designing UI components visually, especially if you want to plan your card design before coding.

**Once your design is ready, you can translate it into HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for your application, possibly customizing it further with your preferred frontend framework or library.
