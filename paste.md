AWS (Amazon Web Services) offers a range of services with a free tier, but it is not entirely free. Here's a clear breakdown of how the AWS free tier works:

### AWS Free Tier Overview

**1. Free Tier Types:**
- **Always Free:** Services that are free forever, within specific usage limits (e.g., AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, etc.).
- **12-Month Free Tier:** New AWS accounts receive free usage for 12 months from the sign-up date (e.g., EC2 t2.micro or t3.micro instances, S3 storage, etc.).
- **Trials:** Short-term free trials for specific features and services.

### Key Points:
- **Activation:** You must create an AWS account and provide billing details, but you won't be charged if you stay within the free tier limits.
- **Limits:** The free tier has specific usage limits (e.g., 750 hours/month of EC2 t2.micro instance, 5 GB of S3 storage, 1 million Lambda requests, etc.). Exceeding these limits incurs charges.
- **Billing:** AWS provides detailed billing and usage monitoring to help prevent unexpected charges.

### Example of Free Tier Usage (12-Months):

| Service          | Free Usage Limit                                   | Duration                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| EC2              | 750 hours/month of t2.micro or t3.micro instances | 12 months from sign-up|
| S3               | 5 GB standard storage                              | 12 months              |
| Lambda           | 1 million requests                                | 12 months              |
| DynamoDB         | 25 GB storage, 200 million requests/month        | 12 months              |
| CloudWatch       | Basic monitoring free                             | Always                  |

### Important:
- **Cost Control:** Always review your usage to avoid charges.
- **Service Availability:** Not all services are free, and some features within services may incur charges.

### Summary:
- **Is AWS free?** Partly, through the Free Tier with usage limits.
- **Will you be charged?** Only if you exceed those limits or use paid features beyond the free offerings.
- **Best Practice:** Use AWS Cost Explorer and set up billing alerts to monitor your usage.
