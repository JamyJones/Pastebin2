Creating a leaderboard for your JavaScript webpage can be enhanced with various libraries that can help you manage the UI and data effectively. Here are some libraries you might consider:

1. **React**: If you're using React, you can create a dynamic leaderboard using components. Libraries like `react-table` can help you manage tabular data easily.

2. **Vue.js**: For Vue.js applications, you can use `vue-table` or `vuetify` to create a responsive and visually appealing leaderboard.

3. **Chart.js**: If you want to visualize the progress, Chart.js can be used to create charts that represent user progress alongside the leaderboard.

4. **D3.js**: For more complex visualizations, D3.js is a powerful library that can help you create custom charts and graphs.

5. **Bootstrap**: For styling your leaderboard, Bootstrap can help you create a responsive layout quickly. You can use Bootstrap's grid system and components to display user avatars and progress bars.

6. **DataTables**: This jQuery plugin can help you create interactive tables with sorting, searching, and pagination features, which can be useful for a leaderboard.

7. **Firebase**: If you need a backend to store user data, Firebase can be a great option. It provides real-time database capabilities, which can be useful for updating the leaderboard dynamically.

8. **Socket.IO**: If you want real-time updates to your leaderboard, Socket.IO can help you implement WebSocket communication for live data updates.

9. **Avatar Libraries**: For user avatars, you can use libraries like `react-avatar` or `gravatar` to easily display user images.

10. **Progress Bars**: Libraries like `react-progressbar` or `nprogress` can help you visually represent user progress in a clean and attractive way.
