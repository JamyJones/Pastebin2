Certainly! To modify or rewrite your policy in Supabase to allow **only read access** to JPEG files (`.jpg`) uploaded by other users, you'll want to:

1. Focus on `storage.objects` for `read` operations.
2. Ensure the policy applies only to `.jpg` files.
3. Restrict the policy to only allow anonymous (public) read access, or specify user-based access as required.
4. Set the operation to `SELECT` (which corresponds to read operations).

Here's a professional and precise policy example:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "public_read_jpeg_only"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO PUBLIC
USING (
  bucket_id = 'your_bucket_name' -- specify your bucket
  AND storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'
);
```

### Explanation:
- `FOR SELECT`: limits the policy to read-only operations.
- `TO PUBLIC`: allows all users, including anonymous, to read; you can replace `PUBLIC` with `auth.role() = 'anon'` if needed.
- `USING` clause:
  - Checks that the object's `bucket_id` matches your target bucket.
  - Uses `storage."extension"(name)` to filter for `.jpg` files.

### Additional notes:
- If you want **only users other than the owner** to read, you can add conditions based on user IDs or roles.
- If you want **public read access to these images**, this policy suffices.
- Ensure the policy is created **after** applying relevant policies for bucket creation.

### Final tip:
Always test policies in a staging environment before deploying to production to avoid unintended data access issues.
