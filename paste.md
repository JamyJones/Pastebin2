## **Title:** My UI skills are so bad, Bootstrap filed a restraining order against me

### **Body:**
Listen, folks, I’ve written **a ton** of scripts, built command-line tools, and even put together a few websites. My back-end skills? **Chef’s kiss**—absolutely solid. But my UI? Oh boy… It looks like I coded it in Notepad while blindfolded.

I **tried** Bootstrap 5, but somehow my pages still look like I just whispered “modern design” into the void and hoped for the best. I look at other developers' UI, and it’s like gazing at a masterpiece in an art gallery. Then I look at mine and wonder if I accidentally opened a 2003 GeoCities page.

On a generous scale, I’d give my own UI **a solid 1/10**—and that’s me being **very** kind to myself. 

So, dear UI wizards and pixel perfectionists, **how do I improve my front-end skills?** Are there secret rituals? Must I sacrifice a CSS file under the full moon? HELP.
