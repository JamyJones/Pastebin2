The command `diff --color=always file.js file2.js` is used in a Unix-like terminal to compare two files, `file.js` and `file2.js`, and display the differences between them with color highlighting. Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `diff`: This is the command used to compare files line by line.
- `--color=always`: This option forces the output to be colored, which helps in visually distinguishing between additions, deletions, and unchanged lines.
- `file.js` and `file2.js`: These are the two files being compared.

To read the output of this command, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch your terminal application.
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where `file.js` and `file2.js` are located.
3. **Run the Command**: Type the command `diff --color=always file.js file2.js` and press Enter.

### Understanding the Output

- Lines that are present in `file.js` but not in `file2.js` will be prefixed with a minus sign (`-`) and typically shown in red.
- Lines that are present in `file2.js` but not in `file.js` will be prefixed with a plus sign (`+`) and typically shown in green.
- Unchanged lines may be displayed without any prefix.

### Example Output

```
- const oldVariable = 10;
+ const newVariable = 20;
```

In this example, the line with `oldVariable` is in `file.js` but not in `file2.js`, while the line with `newVariable` is in `file2.js` but not in `file.js`.

### Additional Tips

- If you want to save the output to a file, you can redirect it using `>` like this: `diff --color=always file.js file2.js > diff_output.txt`.
- You can also use `less -R` to view the output in a paginated format while preserving the color: `diff --color=always file.js file2.js | less -R`.
