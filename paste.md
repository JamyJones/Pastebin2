Yes, within an event listener added via `element.addEventListener()`, the `this` keyword refers to the element the event handler is attached to. This is part of the traditional function context, which is important to understand for correctly handling events.

### Example

```js
const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');

element.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // 'this' refers to 'element'
  console.log(this); // Outputs the DOM element
});
```

### Important

- The `this` context inside a *regular function* (not an arrow function) in an event handler points to the element the handler is bound to.
- If you use an *arrow function*, `this` will NOT refer to the element, because arrow functions inherit `this` from their lexical scope.

### Arrow function example (not recommended if you need 'this' to refer to the element):

```js
element.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log(this); // 'this' in arrow function is inherited, probably window or enclosing scope
});
```

### Recommendation
Use regular functions for event handlers if you want easy access to the element via `this`.

### Summary
- **Yes**, in standard functions, `this` inside an event listener refers to the element.
- For ES6 arrow functions, avoid using `this` if you need the event target, and prefer using the event object:

```js
element.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  console.log(event.currentTarget); // safest way to reference the element
});
```
