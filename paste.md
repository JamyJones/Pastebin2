Here are some libraries and approaches you can use to implement a leaderboard in vanilla JavaScript:

1. **LiveLike Leaderboards** – This library provides an API for managing leaderboards, retrieving entries, and tracking user rankings dynamically. You can integrate it using JavaScript imports and API calls [[0]](https://docs.livelike.com/docs/javascript-leaderboards).
2. **Vanilla Leaderboard** – A GitHub project that offers a simple leaderboard implementation using vanilla JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. It supports auto-sorting, adding new entries, and updating scores [[1]](https://github.com/nirzon47/vanilla-leaderboard).
3. **Custom Implementation** – If you prefer a lightweight approach, you can create a leaderboard using local storage or an external database. A Stack Overflow discussion provides insights into ranking scores dynamically [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70298582/how-to-make-a-leaderboard-ranking-scores-javascript).
