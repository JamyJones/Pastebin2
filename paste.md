**Note:**  
- Replace **[User's Name]** with the actual name of your user.
- Replace **[Verification Link]** with the actual URL that verifies the user's email.
- To make it look visually appealing and consistent with Bootstrap 5, use the button classes like `btn-primary`, `btn-success`, or `btn-outline-primary` based on your design preference.
