Minifying your Webpack package helps reduce bundle size, improve load times, and optimize performance. Webpack provides built-in support for minification via the `TerserPlugin`, which is commonly used for JavaScript minification.

### Steps to Minify Your Webpack Package:

1. **Install TerserPlugin** (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   npm install terser-webpack-plugin --save-dev
   ```

2. **Modify Webpack Configuration (`webpack.config.js`)**:
   ```javascript
   const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

   module.exports = {
       mode: 'production', // Enables built-in optimizations including minification
       optimization: {
           minimize: true, // Enables minification
           minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({
               terserOptions: {
                   compress: {
                       drop_console: true, // Removes console.log statements
                   },
               },
           })],
       },
   };
   ```

3. **Build Your Webpack Bundle**:
   ```sh
   npx webpack --mode production
   ```

### Explanation:
- Setting `mode: 'production'` automatically enables optimizations, including minification.
- Explicitly configuring the `TerserPlugin` allows customization, such as removing `console.log` statements.
- Running Webpack in production mode ensures that all assets are efficiently bundled and minimized.

Using these techniques will ensure your JavaScript files are optimized for production, reducing unnecessary bytes in the final bundle. Let me know if you need further clarification!
