Certainly! Let's analyze and explain how this PostgreSQL function and trigger work together, step-by-step.

### 1. Function Definition

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_leaderboard()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
    UPDATE leaderboard
    SET actual_streak = CASE
        WHEN split_part(streak, '@', 1) IS NULL THEN 0
        ELSE split_part(streak, '@', 1)::numeric
    END
    WHERE user_id = NEW.id;  -- Changed 'id' to 'user_id'

    RETURN NEW;  -- Return the new record
END;
$function$;
```

**What it does:**

- **Function Type:** This is a *trigger function* (denoted by `RETURNS trigger`), which executes in response to specific table events (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **Language:** PL/pgSQL, PostgreSQL's procedural language.
- **Purpose:** To update the `leaderboard` table whenever a new user profile is inserted into the `User Profiles` table.

**Key steps inside the function:**

- **Updating `leaderboard`:** For the user who just inserted their profile, identified by `NEW.id`, the function updates their `actual_streak` value.
  
- **Extracting `actual_streak`:**
  
  - The `streak` column is presumably a string that contains some data, possibly like `'10@someOtherData'`.
    
  - `split_part(streak, '@', 1)` extracts the part before the '@'.

  - The `CASE` statement checks if this part is `NULL`; if so, it sets `actual_streak` to 0.
  
  - Otherwise, it converts this extracted string into a numeric value (likely an integer).

- **Return:** The function returns the `NEW` record, which is the newly inserted user profile. This is standard for trigger functions that don't want to modify the row being inserted.

### 2. Trigger Setup

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS "update_leaderboard_insert_trigger" ON "public"."User Profiles";

CREATE TRIGGER "update_leaderboard_insert_trigger"
AFTER INSERT
ON "public"."User Profiles"
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION "public"."update_leaderboard"();
```

**Purpose:**

- **Drop existing trigger:** Ensures no duplicate trigger exists.
- **Create new trigger:**
  - Fires **AFTER INSERT** on the `"public"."User Profiles"` table.
  - Executes **for each row** inserted (`FOR EACH ROW`).
  - Calls the `public.update_leaderboard()` function.

**Effect:** Each time a new user profile is added, the trigger fires, which runs the function that updates their `actual_streak` in the leaderboard.

---

### 3. How it works together

1. **A new user profile is inserted** into `"public"."User Profiles"`.
2. The **trigger** fires **AFTER INSERT**.
3. The trigger **executes the `update_leaderboard()` function** with the inserted row available as `NEW`.
4. Inside the function:
    - The `leaderboard` table is **updated** for that `user_id` (`NEW.id`), setting `actual_streak` based on parsed data from the `streak` column.
5. The **process completes**, and the new profile insertion continues.

---

### 4. Important notes & best practices

- **Use of `split_part`:** Efficient string parsing. Make sure that the `streak` field has a valid format.
- **Type casting:** `(split_part(...))::numeric` assumes the part before '@' is always numeric or can be cast as such.
- **Handling NULLs:** The CASE ensures that invalid or missing data doesn't cause errors, setting `actual_streak` to 0 if necessary.
- **Trigger timing:** Using `AFTER INSERT` ensures the row exists before attempting to update related data.
- **Security & performance:** Keep triggers simple and efficient; consider indexing if the table grows large.

---

### Summary:

This code creates a trigger that automatically updates a user's `actual_streak` in the `leaderboard` after each new user profile is added by parsing the `streak` string field and updating a relevant row accordingly.
