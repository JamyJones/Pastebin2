It looks like you're trying to create a `VIEW` called `leaderboard`, but it already exists as a table in your database, which is causing the error. In Supabase and PostgreSQL, you can't create a view with the same name as an existing table.

### Solution 1: Use a Materialized View
A possible alternative to using a standard view is a **materialized view**, which can be refreshed periodically rather than being dynamic. If you **don't need real-time updates** but want to periodically refresh your leaderboard table, you can use this:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW leaderboard AS
SELECT user_id, username, streak
FROM "User Profiles";
```

To refresh it manually:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW leaderboard;
```

However, this requires manual refreshing or a scheduled job.

### Solution 2: Use a Trigger for Automatic Updates
If you need **automatic updates whenever a row is inserted, updated, or deleted** in the `User Profiles` table, using a **trigger** might be a better approach.

#### Step 1: Create a Trigger Function
Create a function that will insert or update rows in the `leaderboard` table whenever thereâ€™s a change in `User Profiles`.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_leaderboard()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO leaderboard (user_id, username, streak)
    VALUES (NEW.user_id, NEW.username, NEW.streak)
    ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE 
    SET username = EXCLUDED.username, 
        streak = EXCLUDED.streak;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 2: Create the Trigger
Attach the function as a trigger to `User Profiles` so it updates the leaderboard whenever a row is inserted or modified.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER leaderboard_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON "User Profiles"
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_leaderboard();
```

### Solution 3: Use a View with a Different Name
Since you can't create a view named `leaderboard` (because the table already exists), you could create a view with another name.

```sql
CREATE VIEW leaderboard_view AS
SELECT user_id, username, streak
FROM "User Profiles";
```

### Summary:
- **If you want periodic updates**, use a **materialized view**.
- **If you want automatic updates whenever data changes**, use a **trigger function**.
- **If you prefer a view**, change the name to avoid conflicts.
