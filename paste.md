You asked for an explanation of the following SQL code:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_streak
FOREIGN KEY (streak)
REFERENCES User_Profiles(streak);
```

**Explanation:**

- `ALTER TABLE leaderboard`: Modifies the existing table named `leaderboard`.
- `ADD CONSTRAINT fk_streak`: Adds a new constraint to the table, naming it `fk_streak` for identification.
- `FOREIGN KEY (streak)`: Specifies that the column `streak` in the `leaderboard` table will be a foreign key.
- `REFERENCES User_Profiles(streak)`: Indicates that the foreign key references the `streak` column in the `User_Profiles` table.

**Purpose:**
This code enforces referential integrity between the `leaderboard` and `User_Profiles` tables. It ensures that any value inserted into the `streak` column of the `leaderboard` table must already exist in the `streak` column of the `User_Profiles` table.

**Best Practices:**
- Ensure that the referenced column (`User_Profiles.streak`) is unique or a primary key.
- Use meaningful constraint names for easier maintenance.
- Validate data types and constraints before applying foreign keys.
