It sounds like you're interested in converting JSON data to the JSONB format, which is commonly used in PostgreSQL databases for efficient storage and querying of JSON data. In JavaScript, you can't directly create a "JSONB" type, since that's specific to PostgreSQL, but you can prepare your JSON data so it can be inserted as JSONB.

Here's how you might do it:

```js
// Assume you have a JavaScript object
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };

// Convert it to a JSON string
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);

// When inserting into PostgreSQL using a library like node-postgres (pg),
// you can pass the JSON string and specify the column as type 'jsonb'
const query = 'INSERT INTO my_table (data) VALUES ($1::jsonb)';
const values = [jsonString];
// Then use your database client to execute the query with these values
```

Would you like me to explain or break down this code?
