You asked how to convert your React app after writing it to JavaScript. Typically, React apps are already written in JavaScript (or TypeScript, which compiles to JavaScript). If your app is written in TypeScript and you want to convert it to plain JavaScript, follow these professional steps:

### 1. Remove TypeScript-Specific Syntax
- Change all `.tsx` and `.ts` files to `.jsx` and `.js`.
- Remove type annotations and interfaces.

**Example:**
```tsx
// TypeScript
interface Props {
  name: string;
}

const Hello: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => <div>Hello, {name}</div>;
```
Convert to:
```jsx
// JavaScript
const Hello = ({ name }) => <div>Hello, {name}</div>;
```

### 2. Update Imports
- Remove any imports from `typescript` or type-only packages.

### 3. Adjust Your Build Configuration
- Update your build tools (e.g., Webpack, Babel) to process `.js`/`.jsx` files instead of `.ts`/`.tsx`.
- Remove TypeScript loaders or plugins.

### 4. Remove TypeScript Dependencies
- Uninstall TypeScript and related packages:
  ```bash
  npm uninstall typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
  ```

### 5. Test Your Application
- Run your app and ensure all functionality works as expected.
- Use ESLint to catch any syntax issues.

### Best Practices
- Refactor incrementally, testing after each change.
- Use source control (e.g., Git) to track changes and revert if necessary.

If you need a script or tool recommendation for automating this process, let me know your current setup (e.g., Create React App, Vite, Next.js), and I can provide more targeted guidance.
