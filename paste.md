This code snippet is a PostgreSQL function and trigger setup that updates a leaderboard table based on changes in a "User  Profiles" table. Let's break down the components step by step:

### Function: `update_leaderboard`

1. **Definition**:
   - The function is defined with the name `update_leaderboard`, and it returns a `trigger`. It uses the PL/pgSQL language.

2. **Function Body**:
   - The function begins with the `BEGIN` keyword, indicating the start of the executable part of the function.
   - It performs an `UPDATE` operation on the `leaderboard` table.

3. **Update Logic**:
   - The `SET` clause updates the `actual_streak` column in the `leaderboard` table.
   - The value assigned to `actual_streak` is determined by a `CASE` statement:
     - It uses the `split_part` function to extract the part of the `streak` string before the '@' character. 
     - If this part is `NULL`, it sets `actual_streak` to `0`.
     - Otherwise, it converts the extracted string to a numeric type and assigns that value to `actual_streak`.
   - The `WHERE` clause specifies that the update should only affect the row in the `leaderboard` table where the `user_id` matches `NEW.id`. Here, `NEW` refers to the new row being inserted into the "User  Profiles" table.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function concludes with `RETURN NEW;`, which returns the new record that triggered the function. This is standard practice in trigger functions to indicate that the operation should proceed with the new data.

### Trigger: `update_leaderboard_insert_trigger`

1. **Drop Existing Trigger**:
   - The `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` statement ensures that if a trigger with the same name already exists on the `User  Profiles` table, it is removed before creating a new one. This prevents errors related to duplicate triggers.

2. **Create Trigger**:
   - The `CREATE TRIGGER` statement defines a new trigger named `update_leaderboard_insert_trigger`.
   - This trigger is set to fire `AFTER INSERT` on the `User  Profiles` table, meaning it will execute the associated function after a new row is inserted into this table.
   - The `FOR EACH ROW` clause indicates that the trigger will execute once for each row that is inserted.

3. **Execution of Function**:
   - The `EXECUTE FUNCTION` clause specifies that the `update_leaderboard` function should be called whenever the trigger is activated.

### Summary

In summary, this setup ensures that whenever a new user profile is inserted into the "User  Profiles" table, the `update_leaderboard` function is called. This function updates the `actual_streak` in the `leaderboard` table based on the `streak` value from the new user profile. The logic handles cases where the streak might not be formatted correctly, ensuring that the leaderboard remains accurate and up-to-date.
