Choosing between plain JavaScript and React for your social media application depends on several factors, including scalability, maintainability, and development efficiency.

### **Comparison Between JavaScript and React**
| Aspect         | Plain JavaScript | React |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Ease of Development** | Requires manual DOM manipulation, which can be cumbersome | Uses a virtual DOM, making updates more efficient |
| **Performance** | Can be optimized but requires careful management | Uses efficient reconciliation algorithms |
| **Component-Based Architecture** | Requires manual structuring | Built-in support for reusable components |
| **State Management** | Managed using global variables or external libraries | Comes with built-in state management using hooks |
| **Scalability** | Harder to maintain as complexity increases | Easier to scale using modular components |
| **Community Support** | Strong, but fragmented solutions | Large ecosystem with libraries and plugins |

### **Recommendation**
Since you already have intermediate knowledge of React, leveraging its component-based architecture and state management will greatly improve your efficiency, especially for a social media application where dynamic content and frequent updates are common. React also facilitates better code organization and maintainability, which is crucial as your project grows.

However, if your application is very simple and you want maximum control over every aspect, plain JavaScript might be preferable.
