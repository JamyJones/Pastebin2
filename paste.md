Using vanilla JavaScript (plain JavaScript without frameworks or libraries) to build a social media application that has the potential to scale is generally not the most practical choice. Here's why:

### Considerations for Scaling a Social Media App

1. **Complexity of Features**  
   Social media apps often require features like real-time updates, notifications, messaging, media uploads, and complex user interactions. Handling all this with vanilla JavaScript alone becomes increasingly difficult as the app grows.

2. **Development Speed & Maintainability**  
   Without frameworks or libraries, you may spend more time reinventing common features, handling cross-browser issues, and managing state. This can slow down development and complicate future maintenance.

3. **Performance & Optimization**  
   While vanilla JS can be very performant if optimized correctly, as your app's complexity increases, leveraging frameworks can help you handle performance bottlenecks more efficiently.

4. **Team Collaboration & Scalability**  
   Frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular encourage component-based architecture, making code more reusable, easier to test, and maintainable by larger teams.

### When Vanilla JavaScript Might Be Appropriate

- **Prototyping or MVP:** For a simple prototype or Minimum Viable Product, vanilla JS is quick and straightforward.
- **Learning purposes:** To understand underlying web mechanics.
- **Very small, static sites:** Where complexity is minimal, and scaling isn't a concern.

### Recommended Approach for a Scalable Social Media App

**Front-End:**
- Use a modern JavaScript framework/library such as **React**, **Vue.js**, or **Angular**.
- Implement client-side routing, component reuse, and a state management solution (Redux, Vuex, etc.).

**Back-End:**
- Use scalable frameworks like **Node.js** with **Express.js**.
- Incorporate real-time features with **WebSockets** (e.g., Socket.io).
- Use databases optimized for social media workloads, such as **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, or **Cassandra**.

**Example: Basic React Front-End with REST API**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Feed() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/posts')
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setPosts(data))
      .catch((err) => console.error('Error fetching posts:', err));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id} className="post">
          <h3>{post.author}</h3>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Feed;
```

### Conclusion

While vanilla JavaScript can serve the needs of small projects, **building a scalable social media app** ideally involves leveraging frameworks, libraries, and best practices suited for large-scale, complex, and maintainable applications.

**In summary:**  
- For small scale, quick prototypes, vanilla JS can suffice.  
- For production-grade, scalable applications, **use modern frameworks and tools** that support modular, maintainable, and efficient codebases.
