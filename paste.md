To prevent the default placeholder from displaying when an image fails to load, you can use the `onerror` event in HTML. This event allows you to specify a JavaScript function that will run if the image fails to load. You can either hide the image element or replace it with an alternative image or content.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description" onerror="this.style.display='none';" />
```

In this example, if the image fails to load, the `onerror` event will trigger and the image will be hidden by setting its `display` style to `none`.

Alternatively, if you want to replace the image with a fallback image, you can do the following:

```html
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='path/to/fallback-image.jpg';" />
```

In this case, if the original image fails to load, the `onerror` event will change the `src` attribute to a fallback image.

You can also use CSS to hide the image if it fails to load:

```html
<style>
  .image-fallback {
    display: none;
  }
</style>

<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description" onerror="this.classList.add('image-fallback');" />
```

In this example, the image will be hidden by adding a CSS class that sets `display: none;` when the image fails to load.
