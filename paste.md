To run your transpiled React code in a browser without using Node.js or requiring any libraries via CDN, you need to ensure that your code is bundled into a single file that does not use CommonJS `require` statements. Instead, you can use ES modules or a bundler like Webpack or Rollup to create a standalone file.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your setup to achieve this:

### Step 1: Install a Bundler

You can use a bundler like Webpack to bundle your code. First, install Webpack and its CLI:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

### Step 2: Create a Webpack Configuration

Create a file named `webpack.config.js` in your project root with the following content:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './my_app/static/js/index.js', // Your entry file
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js', // Output file
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
    library: 'MyLibrary', // Expose your library globally
    libraryTarget: 'var', // Use a variable to expose the library
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/, // Transpile .js and .jsx files
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'], // Resolve these extensions
  },
  mode: 'production', // Set mode to production for minification
};
```

### Step 3: Update Your `package.json` Scripts

Modify your `scripts` section in `package.json` to include a build command for Webpack:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
}
```

### Step 4: Create an HTML File

Create an `index.html` file in your project root to include the bundled JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script> <!-- Include the bundled file -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 5: Build Your Project

Run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 6: Open Your HTML File

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Your React application should now run without requiring any `require` statements or additional libraries via CDN.

### Note

Make sure to adjust the paths in the configuration according to your project structure. This setup will bundle your React application into a single file that can be included in an HTML file, allowing it to run directly in the browser.
