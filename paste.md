Certainly! Here's a professional example of a policy to allow only read access (e.g., `select`) to JPEG files (`.jpg`) in a Supabase storage bucket for any authenticated user, and restrict access to other file types or write operations.

### Assumptions:
- The bucket name is `user-photos`.
- Only `select` (read) operations are permitted.
- Access is granted to all authenticated users (not just anonymous).
- Files are stored with their extensions recognized by `storage.extension(name)`.

### Policy for Read Access to JPG Files for Authenticated Users

```sql
CREATE POLICY "read_jpg_files_for_authenticated_users"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-photos'
  AND storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### Explanation:
- `FOR SELECT`: This policy applies to read operations.
- `USING`: Defines the condition under which a user can read objects.
  - `bucket_id = 'user-photos'`: Restrict to a specific bucket.
  - `storage."extension"(name) = 'jpg'`: Limit to JPG files.
  - `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`: Ensure only authenticated users can access.

### Additional considerations:
- To prevent access to other file types, do **not** include any policies permitting `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
- Make sure to set default policies to revoke unauthorized access. For example:

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON storage.objects FROM public, authenticated;
```

- Apply the read policy after revoking defaults or explicit denials for clarity.

### Final note:
Verify the role name used (`auth.role()`) matches your setup. In some configurations, roles could be `'anon'`, `'authenticated'`, or custom.
