The command `diff --color=always file.js file2.js` is used in a Unix-like terminal to compare two files, `file.js` and `file2.js`, and display the differences between them with color highlighting. Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `diff`: This is the command used to compare files line by line.
- `--color=always`: This option forces the output to be colored, which helps in visually distinguishing between additions, deletions, and unchanged lines.
- `file.js` and `file2.js`: These are the two files being compared.

To read the output of this command, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch your terminal application.
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where `file.js` and `file2.js` are located.
3. **Run the Command**: Type the command `diff --color=always file.js file2.js` and press Enter.

### Understanding the Output

- **Lines starting with `<`**: These lines are present in `file.js` but not in `file2.js`.
- **Lines starting with `>`**: These lines are present in `file2.js` but not in `file.js`.
- **Colored Output**: The differences will be highlighted in color, making it easier to see what has changed.

### Example

If `file.js` contains:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

And `file2.js` contains:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, universe!");
}
```

Running the command will show:

```diff
function hello() {
-    console.log("Hello, world!");
+    console.log("Hello, universe!");
}
```

In this output, the line with "Hello, world!" will be highlighted in one color (often red), and the line with "Hello, universe!" will be highlighted in another color (often green).
