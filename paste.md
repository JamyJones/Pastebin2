To remove the trigger from the `auth.users` table in Supabase (which is based on PostgreSQL), you can use the `DROP TRIGGER` command. 

**Important considerations:**
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to alter database triggers.
- If you're using a managed environment like Supabase Studio or a connected SQL client, you can run this command there.
- You should also verify the trigger name before dropping it. Based on your provided code, your trigger is named `trigger_sync_profile_insert`.

---

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Identify the trigger name** (which you've provided as `trigger_sync_profile_insert`)
2. **Drop the trigger from `auth.users`**

### SQL Command to drop the trigger:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_sync_profile_insert ON auth.users;
```

---

### Additional Considerations:

- **If the trigger also has an associated function** and you want to completely remove it:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION sync_profiles_insert();
```

- **Note:** Be cautious when dropping triggers and functions, especially on system tables like `auth.users`, as it could affect your application's behavior. 

---

### Complete example:

```sql
-- Drop the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_profile_insert ON auth.users;

-- Optionally, drop the associated function if not needed anymore
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS sync_profiles_insert();
```

---

### Verify the trigger removal:

You can check if the trigger exists before removing by querying `pg_trigger`:

```sql
SELECT tgname
FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass;
```

If `trigger_sync_profile_insert` is not listed, it has been successfully removed.

---

**After removing the trigger**, your application should revert to its previous behavior regarding user creation, and you should be able to manually create users in `auth.users` again.

**Tip:** Always back up your database or the affected objects before making structural changes, especially in production environments.
