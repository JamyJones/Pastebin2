To compare two files (`file.js` and `file2.js`) with `diff` while preserving color output, you can use the `diff --color=always` command. Here's a professional way to do it and how to interpret and utilize the output:

### Basic Command:
```bash
diff --color=always file.js file2.js
```

This command outputs the differences between `file.js` and `file2.js` with color highlighting, making it easier to identify changes.

### Best Practice: Using `less` for Paginated and Colored Diff
Since the output can be lengthy, it's common to pipe the output to `less` with color support:

```bash
diff --color=always file.js file2.js | less -R
```

- The `-R` option allows `less` to display raw control characters, such as colors.
- This makes it easier to scroll through and read the diff with color highlighting.

### Additional Tips:

- **Unified Diff Format:** For a more concise output, especially suitable for code reviews, use:

```bash
diff -u --color=always file.js file2.js | less -R
```

- The `-u` option generates a unified diff, showing a few lines of context around changes.

### Summary:
- To see colored differences directly in terminal:
```bash
diff --color=always file.js file2.js
```
- To view the colored diff page-by-page:
```bash
diff --color=always file.js file2.js | less -R
```
- For a concise, unified diff:
```bash
diff -u --color=always file.js file2.js | less -R
```

### Note:
Here, `diff` with `--color=always` is GNU coreutils' `diff`. If you're on macOS, you might need to install GNU `diff` via packages like `coreutils` or use alternative tools (e.g., `git diff`, which supports color).
