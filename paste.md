For designing and planning your card with components like image, name, status, and a progress bar, I recommend using **Figma**. Although it's primarily a visual design tool, Figma is open-source-friendly with a free tier, and it's excellent for planning UI components visually before implementing them in code.

### Why Figma?
- **Visual Planning:** Drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to design and prototype your card visually.
- **Component Libraries:** You can create reusable components and styles.
- **Collaboration:** Ideal for sharing or getting feedback from team members.
- **Export Options:** Once your design is finalized, you can export assets or get CSS snippets.
- **Open Source Plugins:** Figma has many free plugins that can help generate code or assist with UI design.

### Alternatives for a more code-centric approach:
- **Htmlstream's Bootstrap Studio (not fully open-source, but free options exist)**
- **Penpot:** An open-source design and prototyping tool for UI design that supports HTML/CSS export.
- **JSFiddle or CodePen:** Not design tools, but great for quickly building and visualizing your component with HTML, CSS, and JS snippets.

### Suggested Workflow
1. Use **Figma** to design your card visually.
2. Export CSS or code snippets from Figma.
3. Implement directly in your project with your preferred code editor.

### Basic Example in HTML/CSS
Here's a simple starting point for your card (for reference or to build upon):

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Image" class="card-image" />
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="name">Component Name</h2>
    <p class="status">Status: Active</p>
    <div class="progress-container">
      <div class="progress-bar" style="width: 70%;"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<style>
.card {
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.card-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 150px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
.card-content {
  padding: 16px;
}
.name {
  margin: 0 0 8px 0;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
.status {
  margin: 0 0 12px 0;
  font-size: 0.9em;
  color: gray;
}
.progress-container {
  background-color: #f3f3f3;
  border-radius: 4px;
  height: 8px;
  width: 100%;
}
.progress-bar {
  background-color: #4caf50;
  height: 100%;
  width: 50%; /* Adjust dynamically based on progress */
  border-radius: 4px 0 0 4px;
}
</style>
```

### Summary
- **Primary recommendation:** Use [Figma](https://figma.com) for visual, drag-and-drop interface planning.
- For code-based prototypes: try [Penpot](https://penpot.app/), an open-source design tool.
- For quick visualization and implementation: use HTML/CSS snippets with your preferred editor.
