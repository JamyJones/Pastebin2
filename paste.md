Title: How can I stop making UI look like a 90s PowerPoint slide?

Body:
Listen, folks. I've written a ton of scripts, built solid command-line programs, and even a few websites for myself. But here's the problem: no matter how hard I try, my UI always looks like it was designed by someone who just discovered HTML yesterday.

Meanwhile, my **back end is basically a masterpiece**—so efficient, so flawless, so heartbreakingly beautiful. And yet, every time I look at my UI, I feel like I should apologize to every front-end developer ever.

Compared to the polished, sleek designs other people create, my work barely scrapes a **1/10 (and I’m being generous).** So, UI gurus and aesthetic wizards—how do I break free from this cycle of questionable design choices? Tips? Resources? Or should I just embrace the chaos and call it "retro"?
