Hey [Her Name],

I just wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate you. I know you can be a bit shy, but I want you to feel comfortable being yourself around me. You have such a beautiful spirit, and I love getting to know you better. If you ever want to chat or hang out, Iâ€™m here for you. No pressure, just whenever you feel ready. ðŸ˜Š

Take care!
