Your `webpack.config.js` configuration appears generally correct and valid for a typical production build setup. Here's a thorough review, along with some best practices and considerations:

### 1. **Basic Validation**
- **Mode:** `'production'` automatically enables minification and other optimizations.
- **Entry point:** `'./static/js/index.js'` is a valid relative path.
- **Output:** The output filename is `'index.min.js'` and the directory is `'dist'`.
- **Resolve alias:** `/static` alias points to your static folder, which can simplify imports.
- **Optimization:** Uses `TerserPlugin` for minification, which is standard.

### 2. **Validation & Recommendations**

#### a) **Alias Path Clarification**
```js
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '/static': path.resolve(__dirname, 'static')
  }
}
```
- Aliases typically do **not** start with a `/`. Usually, they are simple identifiers like `'@static'` or `'@'`.
- For example, changing to:
```js
alias: {
  '@static': path.resolve(__dirname, 'static')
}
```
- Then, in your code, `import something from '@static/js/file.js'` would work more reliably.

#### b) **Output Filename**
- If you want cache busting, consider adding hash to filename:
```js
filename: 'index.[contenthash].min.js'
```
- But if a fixed filename is acceptable, your current setting is fine.

#### c) **Source Maps (Optional)**
- For debugging in production, consider adding source maps:
```js
devtool: 'source-map'
```

#### d) **Additional Optimization Options**
- You might want to explicitly specify **TerserPlugin** options for better control:
```js
new TerserPlugin({
  terserOptions: {
    compress: {
      drop_console: true,
    },
  },
}),
```
- Be cautious with drop_console in production.

### 3. **Complete and Improved Example**

Here's an improved version incorporating these suggestions:

```js
const path = require('path');
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production', // Or 'development' during debugging
  entry: './static/js/index.js',
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@static': path.resolve(__dirname, 'static')
    }
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'index.[contenthash].min.js', // Cache busting
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  optimization: {
    minimize: true,
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        terserOptions: {
          compress: {
            drop_console: true,
          },
        },
      }),
    ],
  },
  devtool: 'source-map', // Enable source maps for production if needed
};
```

### 4. **Summary**

- Your original config is valid for a basic setup.
- Recommendations:
  - Use a proper alias key (without starting `/`)
  - Consider filename hashing
  - Add source maps if debugging is necessary
  - Configure `TerserPlugin` options for production optimization
