The error you're encountering—`TypeError: i.createPopper is not a function`—is likely due to one of the following issues:

### Possible Causes and Solutions:
1. **Missing Popper.js Dependency**  
   Bootstrap's dropdown functionality relies on [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/), especially in Bootstrap 5+. Ensure that you have properly included it in your project.  
   **Solution:** Add the following CDN before the Bootstrap script in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/2.11.8/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
   ```
   If you're using a module-based setup, install Popper.js via npm or yarn:
   ```sh
   npm install @popperjs/core
   ```
   Then, import it in your JavaScript:
   ```js
   import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core';
   ```

2. **Incorrect Bootstrap Version**  
   If you're using Bootstrap 4, the Popper.js dependency must be version 1.x.  
   **Solution:** Ensure that the correct Popper.js version is used:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.1/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Improper Script Loading Order**  
   Scripts must be loaded in the correct order to ensure dependencies are available when Bootstrap initializes.  
   **Solution:** Ensure this sequence in your HTML:
   ```html
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/2.11.8/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.3.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Conflicts with Other Libraries**  
   Check if other libraries are overriding `window.Popper` or causing conflicts.  
   **Solution:** Try logging Popper.js in the console to ensure it's correctly loaded:
   ```js
   console.log(window.Popper);
   ```

### Next Steps:
- Verify that Popper.js is included correctly.
- Check Bootstrap version compatibility with Popper.js.
- Confirm the script loading order.
