Certainly! To reference a column from one table in another table, you typically use a foreign key constraint. Below is a SQL code template that demonstrates how to create a new table that references a column from an existing table.

### SQL Code Template

```sql
-- Assuming you have an existing table named 'existing_table'
-- and you want to reference its 'id' column in a new table named 'new_table'.

CREATE TABLE new_table (
    new_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Primary key for the new table
    existing_id INT,         -- Column to reference the existing table
    other_column VARCHAR(255), -- Other columns as needed
    FOREIGN KEY (existing_id) REFERENCES existing_table(id) -- Foreign key constraint
);
```

### Explanation:
- `new_table`: The name of the new table you are creating.
- `new_id`: A primary key for the new table.
- `existing_id`: A column in the new table that will reference the `id` column from `existing_table`.
- `other_column`: An example of another column you might want to include in the new table.
- `FOREIGN KEY (existing_id) REFERENCES existing_table(id)`: This line establishes the foreign key relationship, ensuring that the values in `existing_id` must match values in the `id` column of `existing_table`.

Make sure to adjust the column names and data types according to your specific requirements.
