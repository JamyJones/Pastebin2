To include `@supabase/supabase-js` version `2.49.8` in your project's dependencies, you have two common approaches:

### 1. Using `npm` command
Run the following command in your terminal within your project directory:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js@2.49.8
```

This command updates your `package.json` to include the specified version automatically.

---

### 2. Manually editing `package.json`
If you prefer to manually add or update the dependency, modify your `package.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "2.49.8",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

to install the specified version and update your `node_modules`.

---

### Additional best practices:
- Keep your dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches and new features.
- Use exact versioning (`"2.49.8"`) to avoid unexpected breaking changes from semver ranges when deploying or sharing your project.

---

### Summary:
- **Command line:**  
  ```bash
  npm install @supabase/supabase-js@2.49.8
  ```

- **Manual (`package.json`):**  
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "2.49.8"
  }
  ```

Followed by `npm install` to sync your dependencies.
