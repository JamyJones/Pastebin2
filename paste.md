In a React app, the code you write is typically written using modern JavaScript syntax, including JSX (JavaScript XML). When you build your React app for production, the build process automatically compiles JSX and modern JavaScript features into plain JavaScript that browsers can understand. 

Here's a step-by-step overview of how this process works and how to produce the plain JavaScript version of your React app:

### 1. Use a Build Tool (e.g., Create React App, Vite, Webpack)

Most React projects use build tools like **Create React App**, **Vite**, or **Webpack**. These tools handle the compilation and transpilation process.

### 2. Run the Build Command

For a React app created with **Create React App**, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces a production-ready build in the `build/` directory.

### 3. What happens during the build?

- **Transpilation:** Babel transpiles JSX and ES6+ syntax to ES5 JavaScript.
- **Bundling:** Webpack (or your build tool) bundles JavaScript files into a few optimized files.
- **Minification:** Minifies the code for production.

### 4. Result: Plain JavaScript Files

The output files in `build/static/js/` are native JavaScript files. These files no longer contain JSX syntax or modern JavaScript features unsupported by older browsers.

### 5. Inspect the Output

Open the generated JavaScript files:

```js
// Example snippet from a built React component
function App() {
  return /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World");
}
```

This code is fully valid plain JavaScript, using React's API (`React.createElement`) instead of JSX.

### Summary of process:

| Step | Action | Result |
|--------|——————————|——————————|
| Write React code | Using JSX, React hooks, ES6+ features | Friendly developer syntax |
| Build process (e.g., `npm run build`) | Babel transpiles JSX into React.createElement calls, converts modern to older syntax | Plain JavaScript compatible with browsers |
| Output files | JavaScript files with React API calls | Fully "converted" to JavaScript |

### If you want to manually convert JSX to JavaScript:

**Before (React code with JSX):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

**After (plain JavaScript):**

```js
import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
}

export default Greeting;
```

### In conclusion:

- Use your build command (`npm run build`) to generate the production JavaScript files.
- These files are already in plain JavaScript form, with JSX transpiled into `React.createElement` calls.
- For browsers that do not support modern JavaScript, make sure your build process includes Babel transpilation (which is standard with Create React App or similar tools).

If you are not using a build process, you would need to manually transpile JSX using Babel, but this is strongly discouraged for production apps due to complexity and potential errors.
