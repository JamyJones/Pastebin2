You’re encountering the following error:

TypeError: 'caller', 'callee', and 'arguments' properties may not be accessed on strict mode functions or the arguments objects for calls to them

This error occurs because, in JavaScript’s strict mode, accessing the caller, callee, or arguments properties of functions or the arguments object is prohibited for security and optimization reasons.

**How to resolve:**

1. **Avoid using arguments.callee, arguments.caller, or function.caller/callee.**  
   These are deprecated and not allowed in strict mode.

2. **If you need to reference the current function, use a named function expression:**

```javascript
// Instead of using arguments.callee:
const factorial = function fact(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * fact(n - 1); // Use the function name directly
};
```

3. **Check if your code or dependencies are using these properties.**  
   Update any outdated libraries or refactor legacy code.

4. **Strict mode is enabled by default in ES6 modules and classes, or explicitly with "use strict":**

```javascript
"use strict";
// Your code here
```

**Best Practice:**  
Always avoid deprecated features and follow modern JavaScript standards for maintainability and compatibility.
