To remove the trigger that you created on the `auth.users` table in Supabase, you'll need to execute a `DROP TRIGGER` statement within a SQL query. Here are the steps:

### 1. Identify the Trigger Name
You've named the trigger `trigger_sync_profile_insert`. 

### 2. Drop the Trigger
Use the following SQL statement to remove the trigger:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_profile_insert ON auth.users;
```

### 3. (Optional) Remove the Function
If you no longer need the `sync_profiles_insert()` function, you can drop it as well:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS sync_profiles_insert();
```

---

### Complete solution:

```sql
-- Drop the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_profile_insert ON auth.users;

-- Drop the associated function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS sync_profiles_insert();
```

### How to execute this:
- Use the SQL editor in the Supabase Dashboard:
  - Navigate to your project.
  - Click on **SQL** from the sidebar.
  - Enter the above SQL commands.
  - Execute the query.

### Important note:
- Make sure to back up your database or ensure that removing these objects aligns with your application's logic.
- After removing the trigger, you should be able to create users normally in `auth.users`.

---

### Troubleshooting user creation:
- If user creation still issues persist after removing the trigger, verify if other database constraints or security policies are affecting `auth.users`.
- Check if there are other triggers, roles, or policies interfering with `auth.users`.
