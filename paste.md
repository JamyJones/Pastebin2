To set the position of the Picture-in-Picture (PIP) window in your browser, you typically need to follow these steps, although the exact method may vary depending on the browser you are using:

### For Google Chrome:
1. **Open a Video**: Start playing a video on a website that supports PIP.
2. **Activate PIP**: Right-click on the video twice (or use the PIP button if available) to select "Picture in Picture."
3. **Move the PIP Window**: Click and drag the PIP window to your desired position on the screen. The PIP window can usually be moved anywhere on the screen.

### For Firefox:
1. **Open a Video**: Play a video on a supported site.
2. **Activate PIP**: Right-click on the video and select "Picture-in-Picture."
3. **Move the PIP Window**: Click and drag the PIP window to reposition it as needed.

### For Microsoft Edge:
1. **Open a Video**: Play a video on a compatible site.
2. **Activate PIP**: Right-click on the video and select "Picture in Picture."
3. **Move the PIP Window**: Drag the PIP window to your preferred location.

### Notes:
- The PIP window can usually be resized by dragging its corners.
- The position of the PIP window may reset when you close it or navigate away from the video.
- Some websites may have specific restrictions or custom implementations that affect PIP functionality.

If you are looking for a more permanent solution or specific settings, you may need to check the browser's settings or extensions that enhance PIP functionality.
