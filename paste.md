Certainly! You can use PostgreSQL triggers to automatically update the `public.profile` table whenever a new user is added to the `auth.users` table. Below is an example that illustrates how to achieve this using a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger:

### Step 1: Create a Trigger Function
First, define a function that will insert a new row into `public.profile` whenever a new user is added to `auth.users`.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.sync_profile()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO public.profile (user_id, name, email)
    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.name, NEW.email);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

### Step 2: Create the Trigger
Now, set up a trigger to call this function whenever a new row is inserted into `auth.users`.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER tr_on_user_insert
AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION public.sync_profile();
```

### Explanation:
- The `sync_profile` function inserts a new row into `public.profile`, using the data from the newly inserted row in `auth.users`.
- The `AFTER INSERT` trigger ensures that each time a new user is added to `auth.users`, the corresponding profile entry is automatically created.

### Best Practices:
1. **Ensure Referential Integrity** – Use `FOREIGN KEY` constraints to maintain consistency between `auth.users` and `public.profile`.
2. **Handle Errors** – You may want to add error handling inside the trigger function to manage edge cases.
3. **Optimize Performance** – If a high volume of inserts occurs, consider using batch processing instead of row-by-row triggers.
