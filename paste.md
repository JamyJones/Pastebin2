To produce React components that run independently of React's dependencies, you'll need to bundle them into standalone JavaScript files that include the necessary parts of React internally. Babel only transpiles JSX and modern JavaScriptâ€”it doesnâ€™t bundle dependencies. For this, you should use a module bundler like Webpack, Rollup, or esbuild.

### Steps to Bundle a React Component as Standalone
1. **Use a Module Bundler**  
   Babel transpiles code but doesnâ€™t bundle dependencies. A tool like Rollup or Webpack will package everything into a single distributable file.
   
2. **Externalizing React (If Needed)**  
   If you want the output to include React, you need to bundle React inside the compiled JavaScript file. Otherwise, you can mark React as an external dependency.

3. **Modify Babel Config (If Needed)**  
   If you're using Babel in isolation, ensure it's set to transform JSX properly without requiring React at runtime.

### Example Using Rollup
Hereâ€™s how you can set up **Rollup** to bundle your React components into a single file.

#### Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install --save-dev rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs rollup-plugin-terser @rollup/plugin-babel
```

#### Rollup Configuration (`rollup.config.js`)
```js
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';
import babel from '@rollup/plugin-babel';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';

export default {
  input: 'my_app/static/js/index.js',  // Entry file
  output: {
    file: 'dist/index.min.js',
    format: 'iife', // Self-contained script
    sourcemap: false
  },
  plugins: [
    resolve(),  // Allows bundling external dependencies
    commonjs(), // Converts CommonJS to ES modules
    babel({ babelHelpers: 'bundled' }), // Transpile with Babel
    terser() // Minify the bundle
  ]
};
```

#### Modify `package.json`
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "rollup -c"
}
```

### Key Benefits:
âœ… **Self-contained JavaScript**â€”React and dependencies will be included.  
âœ… **No external React library required**â€”Everything runs independently.  
âœ… **Optimized & Minified**â€”Ensures performance and reduced file size.
