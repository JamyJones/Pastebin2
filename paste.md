To make a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window in your browser movable, you need to understand that the native PiP window is controlled by the browser and its window management, which typically doesn't provide APIs for custom movement or positioning. However, if your goal is to create a custom implementation of a PiP-like overlay that is fully controllable (including dragging/moving), you'll need to build a custom floating video player within your webpage.

### Approach for a Custom Movable Video Overlay

Here's a professional overview:

1. **Create a floating video element** styled as an overlay.
2. **Use CSS** to position it with `position: fixed` or `absolute`.
3. **Implement dragging functionality** using JavaScript to handle mouse/touch events.
4. **Ensure accessibility and responsiveness**.

### Example: Custom Movable Floating Video Player

#### HTML
```html
<div id="floating-video" class="floating-video">
    <video id="video" src="your-video.mp4" autoplay loop controls></video>
    <div class="drag-handle">â£¸</div>
</div>
```

#### CSS
```css
/* Floating container */
.floating-video {
    position: fixed;
    top: 100px;
    right: 100px;
    width: 320px;
    height: 180px;
    background: #000;
    z-index: 10000;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    border-radius: 4px;
}

/* Make the whole container draggable by the handle */
.drag-handle {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
    cursor: move;
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### JavaScript
```js
const floatingVideo = document.getElementById('floating-video');
const dragHandle = floatingVideo.querySelector('.drag-handle');

let isDragging = false;
let offsetX = 0;
let offsetY = 0;

dragHandle.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  isDragging = true;
  // Calculate the cursor offset inside the element
  offsetX = e.clientX - floatingVideo.offsetLeft;
  offsetY = e.clientY - floatingVideo.offsetTop;
});

document.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
  isDragging = false;
});

document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  if (isDragging) {
    // Prevent the floating box from moving outside the viewport
    let newLeft = e.clientX - offsetX;
    let newTop = e.clientY - offsetY;

    const maxLeft = window.innerWidth - floatingVideo.offsetWidth;
    const maxTop = window.innerHeight - floatingVideo.offsetHeight;

    // Clamp the position
    newLeft = Math.max(0, Math.min(newLeft, maxLeft));
    newTop = Math.max(0, Math.min(newTop, maxTop));

    floatingVideo.style.left = `${newLeft}px`;
    floatingVideo.style.top = `${newTop}px`;
    floatingVideo.style.right = 'auto';
  }
});
```

### Summary:
- You **cannot** directly control the native PiP window's position with standard web APIs; the window is controlled by the browser.
- To achieve moveable floating video, **build a custom overlay** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implement **drag and drop** functionality for user-movable controls.
- For a professional solution, consider **adding constraints** to prevent off-screen dragging, **responsive design**, and **keyboard accessibility**.

If you want to **control the native PiP window programmatically**, note that browser APIs do not expose movement controls - only entry and exit via `video.requestPictureInPicture()` and related events.
