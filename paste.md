In JavaScript, the `switch` statement is a control flow statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a given expression. The flow of a `switch` statement can be summarized as follows:

1. **Expression Evaluation**: The expression provided in the `switch` statement is evaluated once.

2. **Case Comparison**: The value of the expression is compared with the values of each `case` in the order they are defined.

3. **Matching Case**: 
   - If a matching `case` is found, the code block associated with that `case` is executed.
   - If no `case` matches, the code in the `default` block (if provided) is executed.

4. **Fall-through Behavior**: 
   - If a `case` block does not end with a `break` statement, execution will continue into the next `case` block (this is known as "fall-through"). This means that multiple cases can execute the same block of code if they are not separated by `break` statements.

5. **Termination**: The `switch` statement terminates when a `break` statement is encountered, or when the end of the `switch` block is reached.

Here is an example of a `switch` statement in JavaScript:

```javascript
let fruit = 'apple';

switch (fruit) {
    case 'banana':
        console.log('Banana is yellow.');
        break;
    case 'apple':
        console.log('Apple is red or green.');
        // No break here, so it will fall through to the next case
    case 'grape':
        console.log('Grape is purple or green.');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Unknown fruit.');
}
```

### Flow Explanation:
- In this example, the `fruit` variable is set to `'apple'`.
- The `switch` statement evaluates the expression and finds that it matches the `case 'apple'`.
- It executes the code for `case 'apple'`, which logs "Apple is red or green."
- Since there is no `break` statement after the `case 'apple'`, it falls through to `case 'grape'`, executing that block as well, which logs "Grape is purple or green."
- If `fruit` had been something other than `'banana'`, `'apple'`, or `'grape'`, the `default` case would have executed, logging "Unknown fruit."
