Here's a beautified version of your message using HTML and Bootstrap 5, with some emojis to make it more engaging:

```html
<div class="offcanvas offcanvas-end" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasExample" aria-labelledby="offcanvasExampleLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
        <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasExampleLabel">🚀 Welcome to Our Application!</h5>
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
        <p>🎉 <strong>Thank you for signing up!</strong> To complete your registration, please check your email inbox for a confirmation email.</p>
        
        <p>📧 Inside the email, you will find a confirmation link. Click on this link to verify your account.</p>

        <p>🔒 Once your account is verified, return to the login page and log in using your email and password.</p>

        <p>❗ If you do not see the email in your inbox, please check your spam or junk folder.</p>
        
        <button class="btn btn-primary mt-3" data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas">Got it! 👍</button>
    </div>
</div>
```
