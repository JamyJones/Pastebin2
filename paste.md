You want to prevent the default broken image icon from appearing when an image fails to load. A professional approach is to use the onError event handler in JavaScript or React to replace the failed image with a fallback (such as a transparent pixel or a custom placeholder).

**Example: Vanilla JavaScript**

```html
<img src="invalid-url.jpg" onerror="this.style.display='none';" alt="Image" />
```
This hides the image if it fails to load.

**Example: React**

```jsx
<img
  src="invalid-url.jpg"
  alt="Image"
  onError={e => { e.target.style.display = 'none'; }}
/>
```

**Best Practice:**  
- Optionally, you can set a custom fallback image instead of hiding it:

```jsx
<img
  src={imageUrl}
  alt="Image"
  onError={e => { e.target.src = '/fallback.png'; }}
/>
```

This ensures a smooth user experience and prevents broken image icons from appearing.
