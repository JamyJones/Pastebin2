In JavaScript modules, ensuring events are attached after everything is loaded is commonly achieved using the `DOMContentLoaded` event or `window.onload`. The choice depends on whether you want to wait for the entire page (including images) to load or just the document's structure.

### Best Practices:
- Use `DOMContentLoaded` for initializing event listeners when the HTML is fully parsed.
- Use `window.onload` only if you need to wait for all resources (images, iframes, etc.).
- Defer script execution using the `defer` attribute or ES module imports.

### Example using `DOMContentLoaded`:
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
    if (button) {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.log('Button clicked!');
        });
    }
});
```

### Example using ES Module `defer`:
```html
<script type="module" src="script.js" defer></script>
```
With `defer`, the script executes after the document is fully parsed.
