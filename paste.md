Your `webpack.config.js` file is generally well-structured and valid, but I see a minor issue with the alias in your `resolve` configuration.

### **Verification & Corrections**
1. **Issue with `resolve.alias`**:
   - In Webpack, alias keys **should not start with slashes**. Instead of `'/static'`, you should use `'static'`.
   - The alias `'/static'` would not work as expected in your imports, and Webpack would not recognize it properly.

   **Corrected Version**:
   ```js
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       static: path.resolve(__dirname, 'static') // Maps 'static/foo.js' to '<project-root>/static/foo.js'
     }
   }
   ```

2. **General Best Practices**:
   - **Mode Setting:** Consider using `process.env.NODE_ENV` dynamically instead of hardcoding `'production'`, for flexibility between environments:
     ```js
     mode: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production';
     ```
   - **Entry Points:** If you expect multiple entry files, you might want an entry object:
     ```js
     entry: {
       main: './static/js/index.js',
       vendor: './static/js/vendor.js'
     }
     ```
   - **Output Path:** Ensure `dist` exists or gets created dynamically.

### **Conclusion**
Your Webpack config is mostly correct, but adjusting the alias ensures proper module resolution. These tweaks improve flexibility and maintainability. Would you like further optimizations or explanations on another section?
