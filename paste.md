In a `package.json` file, the `main` key specifies the entry point of the package. This is the module that will be loaded when the package is required in another module. By default, if the `main` key is not specified, Node.js will look for an `index.js` file in the root of the package.

For example, if you have the following `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "lib/index.js"
}
```

In this case, when someone requires your package using `require('my-package')`, Node.js will load the file located at `lib/index.js`. This allows you to structure your package in a way that the main functionality is encapsulated in a specific file, which can be useful for organizing larger projects.
