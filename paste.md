When working with React in Vim, the primary file extensions you'll use are:

- **`.jsx`** – If you're writing React components using JSX syntax but not TypeScript.
- **`.tsx`** – If you're using TypeScript along with React.
- **`.js`** – If you prefer plain JavaScript without JSX (using `React.createElement()` instead).
- **`.ts`** – If you're using TypeScript but not JSX (less common for React components).

For optimal Vim experience, consider using plugins like [vim-jsx-pretty](https://github.com/maxmellon/vim-jsx-pretty) or [vim-react-snippets](https://github.com/justinj/vim-react-snippets) to enhance syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
