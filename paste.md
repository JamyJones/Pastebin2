In JavaScript, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that you typically work with as a string or an object. `jsonb` (binary JSON) is a PostgreSQL-specific data type that stores JSON data in a binary, more efficient form, allowing for faster querying and indexing.

**Important:** You cannot directly convert JSON to `jsonb` in JavaScript because `jsonb` is a PostgreSQL data type, not a JavaScript data type or format. However, the usual workflow involves:

1. Sending JSON data from your JavaScript application to PostgreSQL.
2. Using SQL commands or ORM methods to insert the JSON into a `jsonb` column, which PostgreSQL will automatically store as `jsonb`.

### How to insert JSON data as `jsonb` in PostgreSQL via JavaScript

Suppose you are using `node-postgres` (pg) for Node.js. Here's the typical way:

```js
const { Client } = require('pg');

const client = new Client({
  // your database config
});

async function insertJsonbData(jsonData) {
  await client.connect();
  
  const query = `
    INSERT INTO your_table (jsonb_column)
    VALUES ($1)
  `;
  
  // jsonData should be a JavaScript object
  await client.query(query, [jsonData]);
  
  await client.end();
}

// Example usage:
const myJsonObject = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
insertJsonbData(myJsonObject).catch(console.error);
```

PostgreSQL automatically converts the JavaScript object passed as a parameter into `jsonb` if the column is of `jsonb` type.

### Summary:
- **In JavaScript**, you work with objects or JSON strings.
- To store data as `jsonb` in PostgreSQL, pass the object or JSON string to a parameterized query.
- PostgreSQL handles the conversion internally.

---

### Additional notes:
- If you have JSON as a string, parse it into an object before inserting.
- If you are using an ORM (like Sequelize or TypeORM), follow the ORM's method for storing `jsonb`.
