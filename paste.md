Choosing between plain JavaScript and React depends on the complexity and scalability of your social media application.

### **Plain JavaScript**
Using vanilla JavaScript can be a good option if your application is small, simple, and doesn’t require frequent UI updates. You’ll need to manually handle:
- **DOM Manipulation**: Directly modifying elements using `document.querySelector`, `document.createElement`, etc.
- **State Management**: Keeping track of user interactions and updating UI accordingly.
- **Routing**: Manually managing navigation and history using the browser’s `history` API.

However, as your application grows, managing DOM updates efficiently becomes difficult.

### **React**
React provides a more structured approach with features that make development smoother for scalable applications:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is broken into reusable components.
- **Efficient Re-Renders**: Uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI.
- **State Management**: Uses hooks like `useState` or external libraries such as Redux for handling complex states.
- **Built-in Routing**: Using libraries like React Router to manage navigation.

### **Recommendation**
Since you’re already intermediate in React, I recommend using it for scalability, maintainability, and performance optimization. While plain JavaScript gives full control, React significantly simplifies UI management, especially for real-time updates in social media apps. You can leverage your JavaScript skills within React while benefiting from React's abstraction.
