To ensure that events are attached to dynamically created elements only after they are loaded into the DOM, it's common practice to use **event delegation**. This approach attaches event listeners to a parent element that exists when the script runs, and then conditions on the event target to handle events for dynamically added children.

### Why use event delegation?
- It ensures the handler works for elements added in the future.
- It avoids attaching multiple event listeners for each dynamic element.
- It simplifies code management.

### How to implement event delegation

Suppose you're working with a container element (like a `<div id="container">`) where dynamically created elements are inserted.

---

### Example:
```js
// Assume container exists at page load
const container = document.getElementById('container');

// Attach event listener to the container
container.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Check if the clicked element matches our target
  if (event.target && event.target.matches('.dynamic-button')) {
    // Handle click on dynamic button
    console.log('Button clicked:', event.target);
  }
});
```

---

### Handling element creation
When creating a new element dynamically, you just add it to the DOM AFTER the page has loaded:
```js
function createDynamicButton() {
  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.className = 'dynamic-button';
  button.textContent = 'Click Me';

  // Append it to the container
  document.getElementById('container').appendChild(button);
}

// Call this after the page and scripts have loaded
// or upon some event
createDynamicButton();
```

### Using `DOMContentLoaded` to delay setup
If your event delegation setup needs to happen after the DOM has loaded, wrap it:
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const container = document.getElementById('container');

  container.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    if (event.target && event.target.matches('.dynamic-button')) {
      // handle event
    }
  });
});
```

### Best Practices:
- Use event delegation for dynamically added elements.
- Attach your delegated event listener once during initial load.
- Create elements after DOM is ready or adequately loaded.
- Use `matches()` or `closest()` for better handling when targeting specific elements.

---

### Summary:
- Attach event handlers to static parent elements.
- Use event delegation and check `event.target`.
- Create dynamic elements **after** the DOM is loaded.
- Wrap scripts in `DOMContentLoaded` or ensure scripts run after the elements are available.
