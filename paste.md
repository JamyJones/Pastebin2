You asked how quickly a working version of Facebook could be built using generative LLM technology. To provide an accurate answer, I need to clarify your requirements:

- Are you referring to building a full-featured social network similar to Facebook, or a simplified prototype?
- Do you want the generative LLM to assist with code generation, content creation, or both?
- What is your target tech stack (e.g., React, Node.js, Python, etc.)?

Once you provide more details, I can outline a professional development process, estimate timelines, and discuss how generative LLMs can accelerate specific tasks. Let me know your preferences so I can give you a precise and actionable response.
