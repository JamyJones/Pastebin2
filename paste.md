Your SQL policy syntax has a few issues that should be addressed to ensure correctness:

1. **The `{USING | WITH CHECK}` clause isn't valid SQL syntax**â€”you likely meant to use either `USING` or `WITH CHECK` rather than both.
2. **Authorization checks:** `auth.uid()` is a Supabase function that returns the authenticated user's ID. However, `(select auth.uid()::text) = auth.user.id` is redundant and likely incorrect.
3. **String concatenation:** Instead of `auth.uid()::text + '/profile.jpg'`, you should use `auth.uid() || '/profile.jpg'`, as `||` is the correct operator for string concatenation in PostgreSQL.
4. **`WITH CHECK` Clause Misuse:** If you want to restrict inserts, use `WITH CHECK`, and for updates, use `USING`. They perform different validations.

### Corrected SQL Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Give user update and insert permission"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPSERT 
USING (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures'
    AND name = auth.uid() || '/profile.jpg'
)
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures'
    AND name = auth.uid() || '/profile.jpg'
);
```

### Explanation
- The `USING` clause ensures that only authenticated users can update records where their `auth.uid()` matches the `name` format.
- The `WITH CHECK` clause ensures that only records meeting this condition can be inserted.

This should work properly in Supabase's row-level security (RLS) model. Make sure to test it with actual user authentication in place! ðŸš€
