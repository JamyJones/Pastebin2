To remove the trigger from the `auth.users` table in Supabase, you'll need to issue a `DROP TRIGGER` statement. 

Here's the correct SQL command to drop the specific trigger:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_profile_insert ON auth.users;
```

### Steps to execute this:

1. **Access your database**:
   - You can do this via the Supabase SQL editor in the dashboard, psql, or any database client with access.

2. **Run the DROP TRIGGER statement**:
   - Make sure you're connected to your database schema that contains `auth.users` (usually `auth` schema).
   - Execute the command above.

### Important notes:

- **Ensure proper permissions**: You need to have sufficient privileges to drop triggers in the database.
- **Verify the trigger name**: If your trigger has a different name, adjust accordingly. In your case, it's `trigger_sync_profile_insert`.
- **Check if trigger already exists**: Using `IF EXISTS` makes the command safer, avoiding errors if the trigger was already removed.

### Example:

```sql
-- Remove the trigger from auth.users successfully
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_profile_insert ON auth.users;
```

### After removal:
- You will now be able to add users without that trigger interfering.
- If needed, recreate or modify the trigger later with a new function or trigger.

---

### Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter permission issues, verify your user privileges.
- Confirm the trigger's existence with:
  ```sql
  \d auth.users
  ```
  or querying the system catalogs:

  ```sql
  SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass;
  ```
