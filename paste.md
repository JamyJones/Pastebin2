To include a security definer in your trigger function that allows it to bypass Row Level Security (RLS), you need to ensure that the function is defined with the `SECURITY DEFINER` attribute. This allows the function to execute with the privileges of the user who created the function, rather than the user who is invoking it.

Hereâ€™s your modified SQL code with the necessary adjustments:

```sql
-- Inserts a row into public.profiles
CREATE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = ''
AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO "User  Profiles" (user_id, username, streak, created_on, about, profile_image_url, topics)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'username',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'streak',
    NEW.created_at,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'about',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'profile_image_url',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'topics'
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

-- Trigger the function every time a user is created
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.handle_new_user();
```

### Key Changes:
1. **SECURITY DEFINER**: This keyword is added to the function definition to ensure it runs with the privileges of the function owner.
2. **Formatting**: The SQL code is formatted for better readability.

Make sure that the user who creates this function has the necessary permissions to insert into the `User  Profiles` table, as the function will execute with their privileges.
