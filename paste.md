In Bootstrap, when you use tabs to display different content sections, the content of the inactive tabs is typically hidden from view but remains in the DOM. This means that any JavaScript timers, animations, or progress indicators running in the background will continue to operate even if you switch tabs. 

However, the behavior can depend on how you have implemented your timers or progress indicators. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Timers**: If you have set up JavaScript timers (e.g., using `setInterval` or `setTimeout`), they will continue to run regardless of which tab is active. If you want to pause these timers when a tab is not active, you will need to manually handle that in your code.

2. **Progress Indicators**: If you are using a progress bar or similar component, it will also continue to update while the tab is inactive unless you specifically pause it.

3. **Visibility**: If you want to pause or stop certain actions when a tab is not active, you can listen for tab events (like `shown.bs.tab` and `hidden.bs.tab` in Bootstrap) to start or stop timers or animations accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you might pause a timer when a tab is hidden:

```javascript
let timer;
let isActive = true;

function startTimer() {
    timer = setInterval(() => {
        if (isActive) {
            // Update your timer logic here
        }
    }, 1000);
}

$('a[data-toggle="tab"]').on('shown.bs.tab', function () {
    isActive = true; // Tab is active
});

$('a[data-toggle="tab"]').on('hidden.bs.tab', function () {
    isActive = false; // Tab is inactive
});

// Start the timer when the page loads
startTimer();
```

In this example, the timer will only update when the tab is active. You can adjust the logic based on your specific requirements.
