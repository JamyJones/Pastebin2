You asked how to select all elements within a div element whose id is foo using CSS.

To achieve this, use the descendant selector. Hereâ€™s the correct syntax:

```css
#foo * {
  /* CSS properties here */
}
```

This selector targets all elements that are descendants of the element with id="foo". For example, if you want to set the text color of all child elements to blue:

```css
#foo * {
  color: blue;
}
```

This approach is widely used for applying styles to all nested elements within a specific container. Let me know if you need an example with specific HTML or further clarification.
