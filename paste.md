Yes, a class can have asynchronous methods. In JavaScript, for example, you can define an asynchronous method within a class using the `async` keyword. This allows the method to return a Promise and use the `await` keyword for asynchronous operations.

Here's an example:

```javascript
class DataFetcher {
    async fetchData(url) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(url);
            const data = await response.json();
            return data;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
}

// Usage
const api = new DataFetcher();
api.fetchData('https://api.example.com/data')
   .then(data => console.log(data))
   .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Best Practices:
- **Handle Errors Properly:** Always use `try...catch` blocks to manage potential errors.
- **Use Await in Async Methods:** This helps simplify Promise handling and makes the code more readable.
- **Avoid Blocking Code:** Async methods are useful for operations like API calls or database queries that could otherwise block execution.

This approach is widely used in modern development to improve performance and responsiveness. Let me know if you need further clarification!
