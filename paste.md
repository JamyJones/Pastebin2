There are several libraries you can use to implement a leaderboard in vanilla JavaScript. Here are a few options:

1. **Vanilla Leaderboard** – A simple leaderboard implementation using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and TailwindCSS. You can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nirzon47/vanilla-leaderboard).
2. **LiveLike Leaderboards** – A more structured approach that provides API functions for managing leaderboard entries, retrieving rankings, and integrating with user profiles. You can find more details in the [LiveLike documentation](https://docs.livelike.com/docs/javascript-leaderboards).
3. **Custom Implementation** – If you prefer a lightweight approach, you can create a leaderboard using JavaScript arrays and sorting functions. There are discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52507871/creating-a-leaderboard-in-html-js) that provide insights into structuring a leaderboard efficiently.
