To create a truly standalone, dependency-free JavaScript bundle that can run independently without requiring React libraries at runtime, you need to **bundle** your code along with all dependencies into a single file. This process is different from just transpiling with Babel.

### Why your current setup doesn't produce an independent bundle:
- Babel only transpiles modern JS and JSX into compatible JavaScript.
- It does **not** bundle or include external dependencies like React or ReactDOM.
- As a result, your output code assumes React and ReactDOM are available globally at runtime.

---

### Solution: Bundle your code with dependencies

Use a bundler such as **Webpack** or **Rollup** to:
- Bundle your code
- Inline all dependencies into a single file
- Minify if needed

#### Using Rollup (recommended for libraries and simple setups)

Here's a step-by-step:

1. **Install Rollup and necessary plugins:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup @rollup/plugin-babel @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs
```

2. **Create a `rollup.config.js`:**

```js
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';
import babel from '@rollup/plugin-babel';

export default {
  input: 'my_app/static/js/index.js', // your entry point
  output: {
    file: 'dist/bundle.js',          // output file
    format: 'iife',                  // immediately-invoked function expression (suitable for <script>)
    name: 'MyApp',                   // global name if using IIFE
    globals: {
      react: 'React',
      'react-dom': 'ReactDOM'
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
    babel({
      babelHelpers: 'bundled',
      presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
    })
  ],
  external: [] // no external dependencies to exclude, so everything gets bundled
};
```

3. **Update your `package.json` script:**

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "rollup -c"
}
```

4. **Build your bundle by running:**

```bash
npm run build
```

---

### What this produces:
- A single `dist/bundle.js` that includes React, ReactDOM, and your code.
- You can include it in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
<script>
  MyApp.render(); // or whatever your entry's global function is
</script>
```

**OR** if you configured `format: 'iife'`, the bundle will automatically execute, attaching to the window.

---

### Vue Summary:
- Babel transpiles but doesn't bundle dependencies.
- Use a bundler (Rollup/Webpack) to create a single, dependency-free bundle.
- Adjust your build process to include dependencies within the bundle.

---

**Note:** If you prefer not to include React at runtime, you could also write your app using a **vanilla JS library or custom rendering** but that is a more advanced approach.
