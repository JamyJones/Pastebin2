You asked for a professional explanation of how the provided PostgreSQL trigger and function work. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process and best practices:

### 1. Function Definition

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_leaderboard()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
    UPDATE leaderboard
    SET actual_streak = CASE
        WHEN split_part(streak, '@', 1) IS NULL THEN 0
        ELSE split_part(streak, '@', 1)::numeric
    END
    WHERE user_id = NEW.id;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$function$;
```

#### How it works:
- This function is written in PL/pgSQL and is designed to be used as a trigger.
- When invoked, it updates the `actual_streak` column in the `leaderboard` table for the user whose ID matches `NEW.id`.
- The value for `actual_streak` is determined by splitting the `streak` column at the `@` character and taking the first part. If that part is `NULL`, it sets `actual_streak` to 0; otherwise, it casts the value to a numeric type.
- The function returns the new row (`NEW`) as required for row-level triggers.

### 2. Trigger Removal and Creation

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS "update_leaderboard_insert_trigger" ON "public"."leaderboard";

CREATE TRIGGER "update_leaderboard_insert_trigger"
AFTER INSERT
ON "public"."User Profiles"
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION "public"."update_leaderboard"();
```

#### How it works:
- The existing trigger named `update_leaderboard_insert_trigger` on the `leaderboard` table is dropped if it exists, ensuring there are no duplicate triggers.
- A new trigger with the same name is created on the `"User Profiles"` table.
- This trigger fires after every insert operation on `"User Profiles"`, executing the `update_leaderboard()` function for each new row.

### Professional Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Atomicity:** The trigger ensures that whenever a new user profile is inserted, the leaderboard is updated accordingly, maintaining data consistency.
- **Type Casting:** Explicitly casting values (`::numeric`) prevents type errors.
- **NULL Handling:** Using a `CASE` statement to handle possible `NULL` values avoids unexpected results.
- **Trigger Management:** Dropping existing triggers before creating new ones prevents duplicate triggers and potential logic errors.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you insert a new user profile:

```sql
INSERT INTO "User Profiles" (id, ...) VALUES (123, ...);
```

- The trigger fires after this insert.
- The function updates the corresponding row in the `leaderboard` table where `user_id = 123`, setting `actual_streak` based on the current value of `streak`.
