The SQL code you provided is attempting to alter a table named `leaderboard` by adding a foreign key constraint. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **ALTER TABLE leaderboard**: This command specifies that you want to modify the `leaderboard` table.

2. **ADD CONSTRAINT fk_streak**: This part of the command is adding a new constraint to the table. The constraint is named `fk_streak`.

3. **FOREIGN KEY (streak)**: This specifies that the `streak` column in the `leaderboard` table will be a foreign key.

4. **REFERENCES User Profiles(streak)**: This indicates that the `streak` column in the `leaderboard` table references the `streak` column in the `User  Profiles` table. This means that the values in the `streak` column of `leaderboard` must match values in the `streak` column of `User  Profiles`.

### Handling Spaces in Table Names

Since the table name `User  Profiles` contains a space, you need to use double quotes to properly reference it in SQL. The corrected line would look like this:

```sql
REFERENCES "User  Profiles"(streak);
```

### Adding a New Column

If the `streak` column does not exist in the `leaderboard` table, you need to add it before you can create the foreign key constraint. You can do this with the following SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD COLUMN streak INT8;
```

### Complete SQL Code

Putting it all together, if you want to add the `streak` column and then add the foreign key constraint, you would do it in two steps:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD COLUMN streak INT8;

ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_streak
FOREIGN KEY (streak)
REFERENCES "User  Profiles"(streak);
```

This sequence first adds the `streak` column of type `INT8` to the `leaderboard` table and then establishes the foreign key constraint referencing the `streak` column in the `User  Profiles` table.
