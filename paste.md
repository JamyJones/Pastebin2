## Summary
Creating a clear, friendly, and professional email message for user verification using Bootstrap 5 styling.

---  

**Explanation:**

**1. Structuring the email message**  
Your email should include a concise explanation of what the user should do next. It typically consists of:
- Greeting
- Confirmation message
- Call-to-action button (confirmation link)
- Next steps after verification

**2. Making the message clear and straightforward**  
Language should be simple, polite, and instructive. The user needs to understand that they should click the link and then log in.

**3. Using Bootstrap 5 components for email design**  
Bootstrap's email styling is mostly done in HTML files; however, most email clients support inline CSS or embedded styles. For proper compatibility, inline styles are often preferred.

**Sample email message:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  <title>Account Verification</title>
  <style>
    /* Optional: include some inline styles for better compatibility */
    .btn {
      display: inline-block;
      padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;
      font-size: 1rem;
      font-weight: 600;
      line-height: 1.5;
      color: #ffffff;
      background-color: #0d6efd; /* Bootstrap primary blue */
      border: none;
      border-radius: 0.375rem; /* Rounded corners */
      text-decoration: none;
      text-align: center;
    }
    .btn:hover {
      background-color: #0b5ed7;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; color: #212529;">
