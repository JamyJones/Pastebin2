In JavaScript, you cannot directly use the logical OR operator (`||`) within a `switch` statement to combine multiple cases. Each case must be defined separately. However, you can achieve similar functionality by grouping cases together. Here's an example:

```javascript
const value = 'b';

switch (value) {
    case 'a':
    case 'b':
    case 'c':
        console.log('Value is a, b, or c');
        break;
    case 'd':
        console.log('Value is d');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Value is something else');
}
```

In this example, if `value` is either `'a'`, `'b'`, or `'c'`, the same block of code will execute. This is effectively how you can simulate the behavior of using `||` in a `switch` statement.
