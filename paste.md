Here's a clear and concise message you can use to inform new users about the next steps after they receive the confirmation email. This message is designed to be user-friendly and can be styled using Bootstrap 5:

```html
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <h4 class="alert-heading">Welcome to Our Application!</h4>
    <p>Thank you for signing up. To complete your registration, please check your email inbox for a confirmation email.</p>
    <p>Inside the email, you will find a confirmation link. Click on this link to verify your account.</p>
    <p>Once your account is verified, return to the login page and log in using your email and password.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="mb-0">If you don't see the email in your inbox, please check your spam or junk folder.</p>
</div>
```

### Explanation:
- The message is wrapped in a Bootstrap alert component for better visibility.
- It includes a clear heading and structured paragraphs to guide the user through the steps.
- The last line provides additional help in case the email is not found in the inbox. 

Feel free to customize the text or styling as needed!
