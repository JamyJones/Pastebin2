To clarify the concepts of "update on cascade" and triggers in the context of updating the `public.profile` table when a new user is created in the `auth.users` table, let's break it down with examples.

### 1. Update on Cascade

The "update on cascade" feature is used in foreign key relationships. It allows changes made to a primary key in one table to automatically propagate to foreign keys in other tables. For example, if you have a `users` table and a `profiles` table, and you want to ensure that if a user's ID changes, the corresponding profile's user ID also updates, you would set up a foreign key with "ON UPDATE CASCADE".

#### Example:

Assuming you have the following tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE auth.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    bio TEXT
);
```

In this setup, if you update the `id` of a user in the `auth.users` table, the `user_id` in the `public.profiles` table will automatically update to reflect this change.

### 2. Trigger for Updating Related Data

Triggers are used to perform actions automatically in response to certain events on a table, such as an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. In your case, you want to update the `public.profile` table whenever a user is updated in the `auth.users` table.

#### Example Trigger:

Here’s how you can create a trigger that updates the `public.profiles` table when a user’s information changes:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.update_public_profiles() 
RETURNS TRIGGER 
LANGUAGE plpgsql 
SECURITY DEFINER AS $function$
BEGIN
    UPDATE public.profiles 
    SET email = NEW.email, 
        phone = NEW.phone 
    WHERE user_id = NEW.id;

    RETURN NEW;
END; 
$function$;

CREATE TRIGGER tr_on_user_update 
AFTER UPDATE ON auth.users 
FOR EACH ROW 
EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_public_profiles();
```

### Explanation of the Trigger:

- **Function Definition**: The function `public.update_public_profiles` is defined to update the `public.profiles` table. It takes the new values from the updated user and sets them in the corresponding profile.
- **Trigger Creation**: The trigger `tr_on_user_update` is created to fire after an update on the `auth.users` table. For each row that is updated, it executes the `public.update_public_profiles` function.

### Summary

- **Update on Cascade**: Automatically updates foreign key references when a primary key is changed.
- **Trigger**: Automatically performs actions (like updating related tables) when a specified event occurs (like an update on a user).

By using both features appropriately, you can maintain data integrity and ensure that related tables reflect changes seamlessly.
