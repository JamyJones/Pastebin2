You’re encountering a foreign key constraint error from Supabase/PostgreSQL. This error occurs when you try to update or delete a record in the "User Profiles" table, but there are still related records in the "leaderboard" table that reference it via the fk_username foreign key.

**Professional Solution Steps:**

1. **Understand the Relationship:**  
   The "leaderboard" table has a foreign key (fk_username) pointing to "User Profiles". Deleting or updating a user profile that is referenced in "leaderboard" will fail unless you handle those references.

2. **Options to Resolve:**
   - **Delete or Update Dependent Records First:**  
     Remove or update all rows in "leaderboard" that reference the user profile before deleting/updating the user.
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM leaderboard WHERE username = 'the_username';
     -- Then delete from User Profiles
     DELETE FROM "User Profiles" WHERE username = 'the_username';
     ```
   - **Use ON DELETE CASCADE (if appropriate):**  
     If you want deletions in "User Profiles" to automatically remove related rows in "leaderboard", alter the foreign key constraint:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE leaderboard
     DROP CONSTRAINT fk_username,
     ADD CONSTRAINT fk_username
       FOREIGN KEY (username)
       REFERENCES "User Profiles"(username)
       ON DELETE CASCADE;
     ```
     Use this only if cascading deletes are safe for your application logic.

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Always review foreign key relationships before deleting or updating referenced data.
   - Use transactions to ensure data integrity.
   - Consider soft deletes (e.g., setting an is_deleted flag) if you need to retain historical data.

**Summary:**  
You must either remove dependent records from "leaderboard" first, or adjust your foreign key constraint to allow cascading deletes. Choose the approach that best fits your application’s data integrity requirements.
