Choosing between plain JavaScript and React for building a social media application depends on several factors, including your project requirements, your familiarity with the technologies, and the long-term maintainability of the application. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

### When to Use Plain JavaScript:
1. **Simplicity**: If your application is relatively simple and doesn't require complex state management or a lot of dynamic content, plain JavaScript might be sufficient.
2. **Learning Opportunity**: If you want to deepen your understanding of JavaScript and the DOM, building the application with plain JavaScript can be a great learning experience.
3. **Performance**: For very lightweight applications, plain JavaScript can sometimes offer better performance since it doesn't have the overhead of a framework.

### When to Use React:
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React's component-based architecture makes it easier to manage and reuse code, especially in larger applications. This can lead to better organization and maintainability.
2. **State Management**: If your application requires complex state management (e.g., user authentication, real-time updates), React provides tools like hooks and context that simplify this process.
3. **Ecosystem and Libraries**: React has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools (like React Router for routing, Redux for state management, etc.) that can help you build more complex features more easily.
4. **Community and Support**: React has a large community, which means more resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries are available to help you.

### Conclusion:
If you're confident in your JavaScript skills and the application is relatively simple, you might start with plain JavaScript. However, if you anticipate needing more complex features, or if you want to build a scalable application, using React could be the better choice. Given that you rate yourself as intermediate in React, you might find it easier to implement features and maintain the codebase in the long run.

Ultimately, consider the scope of your project and your long-term goals. If you're planning to expand the application in the future, starting with React might save you time and effort later on.
