The error message you're encountering indicates that you're trying to access the `caller`, `callee`, or `arguments` properties of a function that is in strict mode. In JavaScript, strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions.

Here are some key points regarding this error:

1. **Strict Mode**: When a function is defined in strict mode (either by using `"use strict";` at the top of the script or by defining the function with strict mode), it disallows certain actions, including accessing the `caller`, `callee`, and `arguments` properties.

2. **Accessing `arguments`**: In strict mode, you can still use the `arguments` object to access the arguments passed to the function, but you cannot access the `arguments.callee` property, which refers to the currently executing function.

3. **Solution**: If you need to access the function's arguments, you can simply use the `arguments` object without trying to access `arguments.callee`. If you need to reference the function itself, consider using a named function expression or an arrow function.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to define a function in strict mode without causing this error:

```javascript
"use strict";

function myFunction() {
    // You can access arguments normally
    console.log(arguments);

    // Do not use arguments.callee
    // console.log(arguments.callee); // This will throw an error in strict mode
}

// Call the function
myFunction(1, 2, 3);
```

If you need to reference the function itself, you can do it like this:

```javascript
"use strict";

const myFunction = function innerFunction() {
    console.log(arguments);
    // You can call innerFunction here if needed
};

// Call the function
myFunction(1, 2, 3);
```

By following these guidelines, you should be able to avoid the TypeError related to strict mode functions.
