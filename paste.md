The error message indicates that your Webpack configuration has multiple entries for the same entry point, or perhaps the same file is being referenced more than once in a way that causes duplication. According to your provided configuration, it appears to be correct at first glance since you're specifying `entry` only once.

However, this error can also occur if:
- The configuration is included or merged with other configs elsewhere (in multi-configuration setups).
- There is another configuration or plugin inadvertently modifying or extending the Webpack config.
- The build system or scripts are being run multiple times with conflicting configurations.

**Given your current config:**  
```js
entry: './my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js'
```

**The fix:**

1. **Ensure the configuration is clean and not duplicated elsewhere**:  
   Make sure that your `webpack.config.js` is not being imported or combined with other configs that might add the same entry multiple times.

2. **Explicitly specify `entry` as an array (if needed):**  
   If you want to include multiple files in the entry point, use an array:
   ```js
   entry: ['./my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js']
   ```
   But in your case, since you only have one file, this might not be necessary.

3. **Check for duplicates within the configuration or build scripts**:  
   Make sure you are not passing the same file multiple times, nor calling Webpack with conflicting parameters.

4. **Update your config to avoid ambiguity, e.g., remove potential duplicates:**
   - Double-check any Webpack plugin or loader configurations.
   - Confirm that you're not including this entry multiple times or through other configuration files.

**A clean, minimal example (your config should work as is):**
```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js', // single entry point
  output: {
    filename: 'all_react.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  mode: 'production',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: 'babel-loader',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Additional recommendations:

- **Check for duplicate entries:** Verify your build process or scripts are not specifying additional entries elsewhere.
- **Clean the build directory:** Delete `dist` or other build folders before rebuilding to avoid residual files causing conflicts.
- **Update Webpack:** Make sure you're using an up-to-date version compatible with your configuration.

---

### Summary:

Your specific configuration looks correct, so the problem likely stems from how Webpack is invoked or combined with other configs. Double-check for duplicated entries in your build setup and ensure only one entry point is specified. If you want to safeguard, you can enforce entries as arrays or validate your configuration in a separate test file.

---

**If problem persists, you can try:**

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: [
    './my_app/static/js/react-bundle.js'
  ],
  ...
};
```

But usually, a single string entry should suffice unless multiple files are to be bundled together.
