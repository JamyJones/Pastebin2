Let me clarify something important - React applications are already written in JavaScript. React is a JavaScript library, so there's no direct "conversion" needed. However, I think you might be asking about one of these scenarios:

1. Converting JSX to vanilla JavaScript:
- JSX (the HTML-like syntax in React) gets transformed to regular JavaScript during the build process using tools like Babel
- Example:
```jsx
// JSX
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

// Transforms to JavaScript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World');
```

2. Creating a non-React version of your app:
If you want to rebuild your React app using vanilla JavaScript, you'll need to:
- Remove component-based architecture
- Replace React state management with native JavaScript
- Handle DOM manipulation directly

Here's a simple comparison:
```jsx
// React version
function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
            Count: {count}
        </button>
    );
}

// Vanilla JavaScript version
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.textContent = `Count: ${count}`;
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        count++;
        button.textContent = `Count: ${count}`;
    });
    document.body.appendChild(button);
}
```

Could you tell me more about what you're trying to achieve? That would help me provide more specific guidance for your use case.
