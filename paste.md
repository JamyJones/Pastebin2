To convert a text file into a PDF using `mutool`, you can use the `mutool convert` command. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install MuPDF**: If you haven't already installed MuPDF, you can download it from the official website or install it using a package manager.

2. **Open your terminal**: You will need to use the command line to execute the conversion.

3. **Use the `mutool convert` command**: The basic syntax for converting a text file to a PDF is as follows:

   ```bash
   mutool convert -o output.pdf input.txt
   ```

   Here, `output.pdf` is the name of the PDF file you want to create, and `input.txt` is the name of the text file you want to convert.

4. **Run the command**: After typing the command, press Enter. If everything is set up correctly, `mutool` will create a PDF file from your text file.

### Example

If you have a text file named `example.txt`, you would run:

```bash
mutool convert -o example.pdf example.txt
```

This will generate a PDF file named `example.pdf` in the same directory as your text file.

### Additional Options

You can explore more options and configurations by checking the `mutool` documentation or by running:

```bash
mutool convert -h
```

This will provide you with help and additional command-line options for the `mutool convert` command.
