To achieve absolute imports in Webpack for your Node.js project, you can configure the `resolve.alias` option in your Webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`). This allows you to define custom paths that can be used as absolute references.

### **Steps to Set Up Absolute Imports in Webpack**
1. Open your Webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`).
2. Modify the `resolve` property to include an alias for your root directory.

Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'), // Maps '@/foo.js' to '<project-root>/src/foo.js'
      'static': path.resolve(__dirname, 'static') // Maps 'static/foo.js' to '<project-root>/static/foo.js'
    }
  }
};
```

### **Usage in Your Code**
After setting up the alias, you can import files using absolute paths:

```javascript
import foo from 'static/js/foo.js'; // Absolute path alias for static directory
import bar from '@/components/bar.js'; // Using '@' as a shorthand for 'src'
```

### **Best Practices**
- Use meaningful aliases (`@` for `src` is a common convention).
- Keep aliases organized and documented to prevent confusion.
- Use TypeScript or ESLint path resolution to ensure the same alias is recognized in your IDE.
