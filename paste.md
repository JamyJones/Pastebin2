## **Modifying Supabase Database Policy to Use `user_id` Instead of Email**<br>

---

### **Explanation**<br>

#### **1. Understanding JWT in Supabase**<br>
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used in Supabase for authentication and authorization. They contain user information, including the user's ID (`auth.uid()`) and email, which can be extracted for database policies.<br>

#### **2. Modifying the Policy to Use `user_id` Instead of Email**<br>
Since you want to authenticate users based on their `user_id` rather than their email, you need to modify the policy to check against `auth.uid()` instead of extracting the email from the JWT.<br>

#### **3. Authentication Without JWT**<br>
Supabase primarily relies on JWT for authentication. However, if you want to authenticate users without JWT, you can use **Row Level Security (RLS)** with `auth.uid()` to verify the authenticated user's ID directly.<br>

### **Modified Policy Using `user_id` Instead of Email**<br>

```sql
create policy "Enable update for users based on user_id"
on "public"."User Profiles"
for update using (
  auth.uid() = user_id
) with check (
  auth.uid() = user_id
);
```
#### **Explanation of the Code**<br>
- `auth.uid()` â†’ Retrieves the authenticated user's ID from Supabase.
- `user_id` â†’ The primary key column in the `User Profiles` table.
- `for update using (...)` â†’ Ensures that only users whose `auth.uid()` matches their `user_id` can update their profile.
- `with check (...)` â†’ Ensures that the authenticated user can only modify their own data.<br>

### **Alternative Authentication Without JWT**<br>
If you want to authenticate users without JWT, you can use **Supabase Auth** with **Session-based authentication** or **OAuth providers**. However, Supabase internally still uses JWT for authentication, even if you don't manually extract it.<br>
