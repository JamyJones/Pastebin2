You asked about IndexedDB for the web. IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. It allows web applications to store and retrieve objects that are indexed with a key, enabling efficient searching and retrieval.

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous and transactional.
- Stores large amounts of data (much more than localStorage).
- Supports complex data types (objects, arrays, files).
- Indexed for fast lookups.

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Offline web applications.
- Caching resources for performance.
- Storing user-generated content locally.

**Basic Example:**

```javascript
// Open (or create) a database
const request = indexedDB.open('MyDatabase', 1);

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  const db = event.target.result;
  // Create an object store with a key path
  db.createObjectStore('users', { keyPath: 'id' });
};

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  const db = event.target.result;
  // Start a transaction
  const transaction = db.transaction(['users'], 'readwrite');
  const store = transaction.objectStore('users');
  // Add data
  store.add({ id: 1, name: 'Alice' });
};
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always handle errors (e.g., using `onerror` handlers).
- Use versioning to manage schema changes.
- Keep transactions short to avoid blocking the UI.
