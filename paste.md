To select all `<button>`, `<select>`, and `<input>` elements within a `<div>` element with the ID `foo`, you can use the following CSS selector:

```css
#foo button,
#foo select,
#foo input {
    /* Your styles here */
}
```

This selector targets all `<button>`, `<select>`, and `<input>` elements that are descendants of the `<div>` with the ID `foo`. You can replace `/* Your styles here */` with the actual styles you want to apply to these elements.
