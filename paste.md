Your SQL policy syntax contains a few issues that need revision to work properly. Let’s go through some improvements:

### Issues & Fixes:
1. **`USING` vs `WITH CHECK` Clause**
   - The `{USING | WITH CHECK}` syntax is incorrect—it’s likely a placeholder you need to replace with either `USING` or `WITH CHECK`. 
   - `USING`: Controls row-level filtering for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
   - `WITH CHECK`: Controls row-level filtering for `INSERT`.

2. **Incorrect Expression for `auth.uid()`**
   - `auth.uid()` already returns the authenticated user's UID as a `text` type in Supabase. Explicitly casting it (`::text`) is redundant.
   - The condition `(select auth.uid()::text) = auth.user.id` is problematic and doesn’t work as expected.

### Suggested Corrected SQL:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Give user update and insert permission"
ON storage.objects 
FOR UPSERT 
USING (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
    AND name = auth.uid() || '/profile.jpg'
)
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
    AND name = auth.uid() || '/profile.jpg'
);
```

### Explanation:
- I replaced `{USING | WITH CHECK}` with **separate `USING` and `WITH CHECK` conditions**, as required by Supabase row-level security (RLS).
- Used the correct string concatenation syntax (`||` instead of `+`).
- Removed redundant subqueries (`SELECT auth.uid()::text`).

This ensures that only **authenticated users** can perform UPSERT operations on objects within the `profile-pictures` bucket, restricted to their own profile images.
