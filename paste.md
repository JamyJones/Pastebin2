The error you're encountering with Supabase indicates a foreign key constraint violation. Specifically, you're attempting to **update or delete** a record in the **"User Profiles"** table that is still being referenced by the **"leaderboard"** table through the foreign key **"fk_username"**.

---

### Explanation of the Error:

- **Error Code `23503`**: This is a PostgreSQL error code indicating a **foreign key violation**.
- **Message Breakdown**:
  - You are trying to **update or delete** a user profile.
  - The **"leaderboard"** table **still references** this "User Profile" via the foreign key **"fk_username"**.
- **Implication**: PostgreSQL prevents you from deleting or updating a row in "User Profiles" if that row's primary key is still being referenced in "leaderboard" to maintain referential integrity.

---

### How to Solve the Issue:

**1. Understand your data relationships:**

- Confirm that the **"leaderboard"** table references the **"User Profiles"** table via **"fk_username"**.
- Determine whether the reference is on a **unique or non-unique** field (likely the primary key or username).

**2. Options to resolve this:**

- **a. Delete or update referencing rows first**:
  - Remove or modify the dependent entries in **"leaderboard"** before deleting the referenced user in **"User Profiles"**.

- **b. Use ON DELETE / ON UPDATE CASCADE constraints**:
  - Modify the foreign key to automatically delete or update child rows when the parent row is deleted or updated.
  
- **c. Decide on the appropriate action based on your data integrity rules:**
  - If it's valid to delete a user and remove their leaderboard entries, then:
    - Delete from **"leaderboard"** where **fk_username** matches the user.
    - Then delete from **"User Profiles"**.

---

### Recommended Approach:

**First, delete dependent records in the "leaderboard" table before deleting the user.**

```sql
-- Step 1: Remove references in leaderboard
DELETE FROM leaderboard WHERE fk_username = 'user_to_delete';

-- Step 2: Remove the user profile
DELETE FROM "User Profiles" WHERE username = 'user_to_delete';
```

---

### Automating with Supabase (via SQL or SDK):

**Using SQL (via SQL editor / pgAdmin):**

```sql
BEGIN;

DELETE FROM leaderboard WHERE fk_username = 'user_to_delete';

DELETE FROM "User Profiles" WHERE username = 'user_to_delete';

COMMIT;
```

**Using Supabase JavaScript SDK:**

```js
// Delete from leaderboard
const { data: leaderboardData, error: leaderboardError } = await supabase
  .from('leaderboard')
  .delete()
  .eq('fk_username', 'user_to_delete');

if (leaderboardError) {
  console.error('Error deleting from leaderboard:', leaderboardError);
  // Handle error
}

// Delete user profile
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('User Profiles')
  .delete()
  .eq('username', 'user_to_delete');

if (error) {
  console.error('Error deleting user profile:', error);
  // Handle error
}
```

---

### Alternative: Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` (if appropriate):

**Modify foreign key constraint:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
DROP CONSTRAINT fk_username;

ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_username
FOREIGN KEY (fk_username)
REFERENCES "User Profiles"(username)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

**Impact**: Deleting a user profile will automatically delete all related leaderboard entries.

---

### Summary:
- You cannot delete or update a parent row if child records still reference it.
- Remove dependent records **first**, or modify the foreign key constraint to **cascade**.
- Use consistent transaction handling to maintain data integrity.
