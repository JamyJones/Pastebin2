To prevent an `<img>` element from displaying the default placeholder when an image fails to load, you can use the `onerror` event in JavaScript. This allows you to replace the broken image with another image or hide the element altogether.

### Example 1: Replacing the broken image
```html
<img src="invalid-image.jpg" alt="Fallback Image" onerror="this.src='fallback-image.jpg';">
```
Here, if the image `invalid-image.jpg` fails to load, the `onerror` event sets `this.src` to `fallback-image.jpg`.

### Example 2: Hiding the image when it fails to load
```html
<img src="invalid-image.jpg" alt="Broken Image" onerror="this.style.display='none';">
```
This approach ensures that if the image fails to load, it will be removed from the page instead of showing a broken image placeholder.

### Best Practices:
- Always provide an `alt` attribute for accessibility and SEO purposes.
- If using a fallback image, ensure that the URL is correct and accessible.
- Minimize reliance on third-party images to prevent unnecessary failures.
- Consider using CSS to display a background image as a fallback instead.
