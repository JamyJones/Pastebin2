In JavaScript, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format, while JSONB (Binary JSON) is commonly used in databases like PostgreSQL for efficient storage and querying.

If you're working with PostgreSQL and need to convert JSON to JSONB, the conversion typically happens at the database level. You can send the JSON data to PostgreSQL and use SQL to cast it to JSONB:

```sql
SELECT '{"key": "value"}'::jsonb;
```

However, if you need to prepare JSON data for database insertion in JavaScript, just ensure your JSON is correctly formatted:

```javascript
const jsonData = JSON.stringify({ key: "value" });
// Pass jsonData to the database where it can be converted to JSONB
```

If you're interacting with PostgreSQL through Node.js, libraries like `pg` will handle JSONB storage automatically when inserting JSON data into a `jsonb` column.
