If you’re missing `createRoot()` in your `ReactDOM` class, you’re likely using an older version of React before version 18. In React 18, `createRoot()` was introduced as part of the new concurrent rendering capabilities, replacing the previous `ReactDOM.render()` method.

### Solution:
First, check your React version:
```bash
npm list react-dom
```
If you're on React 17 or below, `createRoot()` won't be available. You need to upgrade to React 18:
```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```
### Correct Usage:
After updating, you should modify your entry file (e.g., `index.js` or `main.js`) to use `createRoot()`:
```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```
### Notes:
- If you’re using an outdated version of ReactDOM, you'll need to continue using `ReactDOM.render()`, but upgrading is recommended to take advantage of performance improvements.
- If you're working in a legacy project and upgrading isn’t an option, ensure that your dependencies remain consistent with React 17.
