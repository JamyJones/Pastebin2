Minifying your Webpack package helps reduce its size, improving load times and performance. Webpack provides built-in support for minification through the **TerserPlugin**, which is a commonly used minifier for JavaScript files.

### Steps to Minify Your Webpack Package

1. **Install TerserPlugin (if not already installed)**:
   ```bash
   npm install terser-webpack-plugin --save-dev
   ```

2. **Configure Webpack to use the plugin**:
   Modify your Webpack configuration (`webpack.config.js`) to enable minification:

   ```javascript
   const TerserPlugin = require("terser-webpack-plugin");

   module.exports = {
     mode: "production", // Enables built-in optimizations including minification
     optimization: {
       minimize: true,
       minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({
         terserOptions: {
           compress: {
             drop_console: true, // Removes console logs
           },
         },
       })],
     },
   };
   ```

### Explanation
- Setting `mode: "production"` automatically enables minification.
- `minimize: true` ensures minification is applied.
- `TerserPlugin` is explicitly added to customize minification options.

### Best Practices
- Always use `mode: "production"` for minification; Webpack handles optimizations automatically.
- Remove unnecessary code (like `console.log`) for better performance.
- Consider tree-shaking to remove unused imports by ensuring `sideEffects: false` in `package.json`.
