You asked whether the following SQL statement is correct:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD CONSTRAINT streak
FOREIGN KEY (streak)
REFERENCES "User Profiles"(streak);
```

Here are some professional considerations:

1. Table and Column Names:
   - SQL identifiers with spaces (like "User Profiles") must be quoted, as you did.
   - Ensure both leaderboard.streak and "User Profiles".streak columns exist and are of the same data type.

2. Constraint Naming:
   - The constraint name streak is valid, but using a more descriptive name (e.g., fk_leaderboard_streak) is a best practice.

3. Referential Integrity:
   - The referenced column ("User Profiles".streak) should be a PRIMARY KEY or have a UNIQUE constraint.

4. Example with Best Practices:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_leaderboard_streak
FOREIGN KEY (streak)
REFERENCES "User Profiles"(streak);
```

5. Common Issues:
   - If "User Profiles".streak is not unique, this will fail.
   - If there are existing values in leaderboard.streak that do not match "User Profiles".streak, the statement will fail.

Let me know if you need help checking your schema or want to see how to define the referenced column as UNIQUE.
