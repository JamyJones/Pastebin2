It looks like you are running into an issue because your `leaderboard` table already exists, and you are trying to create a view with the same name. A `VIEW` in SQL is essentially a virtual table that dynamically represents the results of a query, meaning it is not stored physically but updates automatically based on changes in the referenced table.

### Solutions:
#### 1. **Using a View (Preferred Approach)**
Instead of manually copying data, if you just need a dynamic table that updates when `User Profiles` changes, you should drop the existing `leaderboard` table and create a view:

```sql
DROP TABLE leaderboard; -- Remove existing table
CREATE VIEW leaderboard AS
SELECT user_id, username, streak
FROM "User Profiles";
```
Now, `leaderboard` will automatically reflect any changes made in `User Profiles`, including insertions, updates, and deletions.

#### 2. **Using a Trigger (If Physical Copy is Needed)**
If you require a separate physical table (`leaderboard`) that automatically updates when `User Profiles` changes, use **triggers**. Triggers will ensure that any insert, update, or delete operation in `User Profiles` also affects `leaderboard`.

1. **Ensure the `leaderboard` table exists:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leaderboard (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    streak INT NOT NULL
);
```

2. **Create a trigger function to automatically update `leaderboard`:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_leaderboard()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO leaderboard (user_id, username, streak)
    VALUES (NEW.user_id, NEW.username, NEW.streak)
    ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE 
    SET username = EXCLUDED.username, streak = EXCLUDED.streak;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

3. **Create a trigger to execute the function when `User Profiles` changes:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER user_profiles_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON "User Profiles"
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_leaderboard();
```

### Which Method Should You Use?
- If you need real-time updates and donâ€™t need a separate stored table â†’ **Use a View (Solution 1)**
- If you need an independent table that gets physically updated â†’ **Use a Trigger (Solution 2)**
