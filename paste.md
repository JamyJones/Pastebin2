To read the differences between `file.js` and `file2.js` with colored output, you can use the `diff` command in a terminal with `--color=always`:

```sh
diff --color=always file.js file2.js
```

However, if the output doesn't display colors as expected, your terminal might not support colored output by default. In that case, you can use `colordiff`, which is specifically designed for syntax highlighting in `diff` results.

### Install `colordiff` (if not already installed):
- **Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install colordiff
  ```
- **Mac (via Homebrew)**:
  ```sh
  brew install colordiff
  ```

### Use `colordiff`:
```sh
colordiff file.js file2.js
```

If you prefer a more structured diff output, consider using `git diff` or `diff-so-fancy` for improved readability:

```sh
git diff --color=always file.js file2.js
```

Would you like recommendations on improving the readability of your diffs?
