The command `diff --color=always file.js file2.js` is used in a Unix-like terminal to compare two files, `file.js` and `file2.js`, and display the differences between them with color highlighting. Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `diff`: This is the command used to compare files line by line.
- `--color=always`: This option forces the output to be colored, which helps in visually distinguishing between additions, deletions, and unchanged lines.
- `file.js` and `file2.js`: These are the two files being compared.

To read the output of this command, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch your terminal application.
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing `file.js` and `file2.js`.
3. **Run the Command**: Type the command `diff --color=always file.js file2.js` and press Enter.

### Understanding the Output

- Lines that are present in `file.js` but not in `file2.js` will be prefixed with a minus sign (`-`) and typically shown in red.
- Lines that are present in `file2.js` but not in `file.js` will be prefixed with a plus sign (`+`) and typically shown in green.
- Unchanged lines may be displayed without any prefix.

### Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of what the output might look like:

```
- const oldFunction = () => { return 'old'; }
+ const newFunction = () => { return 'new'; }
```

In this example, the first line (in red) indicates that `oldFunction` is present in `file.js` but not in `file2.js`, while the second line (in green) indicates that `newFunction` is present in `file2.js` but not in `file.js`.

### Additional Tips

- If you want to save the output to a file, you can redirect it using `>` like this: `diff --color=always file.js file2.js > diff_output.txt`.
- You can also use `diff -u` for a unified format, which provides a more compact view of the differences.

This command is very useful for developers to quickly see changes between different versions of code files.
