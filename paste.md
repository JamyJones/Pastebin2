In Bootstrap 5, the `offcanvas` component is typically used to create sidebars or hidden content areas that slide in. However, if your goal is to prevent users from accessing content unless the offcanvas is interacted with, you might consider using it as a login form or authentication gateway. Here's an approach:

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Trigger Offcanvas Automatically**: Open the offcanvas as soon as the page loads.
2. **Restrict Content Access**: Disable interactions with the main page until the user performs an action (e.g., enters credentials).
3. **Use JavaScript to Control Access**: Ensure users canâ€™t dismiss the offcanvas without authentication.

### Example Code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap 5 Offcanvas Restriction</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <style>
        body {
            pointer-events: none; /* Initially disable user interactions */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Offcanvas Component -->
    <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start show" tabindex="-1" id="authCanvas" data-bs-backdrop="static">
        <div class="offcanvas-header">
            <h5 class="offcanvas-title">Restricted Access</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="offcanvas-body">
            <p>Please log in to access the page.</p>
            <button class="btn btn-primary" id="loginButton">Login</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h1>Restricted Page Content</h1>
        <p>This content is locked behind the offcanvas authentication.</p>
    </div>

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('loginButton').addEventListener('click', function () {
            document.getElementById('authCanvas').classList.remove('show');
            document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto'; // Allow interactions
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
1. **Offcanvas Auto-Opens**: The `show` class ensures the offcanvas appears immediately.
2. **Backdrop Static**: Prevents users from closing it by clicking outside.
3. **Pointer Events Disabled**: Initially restricts interactions with the page.
4. **Login Button**: When clicked, it removes the offcanvas and restores page access.
